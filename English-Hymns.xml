		<title>The Servant King</title>
		<content>From heaven you came helpless
babe Entered our world, your glory veiled Not to be served, but to serve And
give your life, that we might live

This is our God The Servant King He calls us now to follow him To bring our
lives as daily offering Of worship to the Servant King

There in the garden of tears My heavy load, he chose to bear His heart with
sorrow was torn Yet not my will but yours he said


This is our God, the Servant King He calls us now to follow him To bring our
lives as daily offering Of worship to the Servant King

Come see his hands and his feet The scars that speak of sacrifice Hands that
flung stars into space To cruel nails surrendered

This is our God, the Servant King He calls us now to follow him To bring our
lives as daily offering Of worship to the Servant King

So let us learn how to serve And in our lives enthrone him Each others needs to
prefer For it is Christ we’re serving This is our God, the Servant King

He calls us now to follow him To bring our lives as daily offering Of worship to
the Servant King

		<title>Amazing Grace</title>
		<content>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.... I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind,
but now, I see. T’was Grace that taught... my heart to fear. And Grace, my fears
relieved. How precious did that Grace appear... the hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares... we have already come. T’was Grace that
brought us safe thus far... and Grace will lead us home. The Lord has promised
good to me... His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be... as
long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease, I shall
possess within the veil, a life of joy and peace. When we’ve been here ten
thousand years... bright shining as the sun. We’ve no less days to sing God’s
praise... then when we’ve first begun.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me.... I once was
lost but now am found, Was blind, but now, I see.

was mistaken, now what do I do?

failures, yet knowing you’ll renew.

Coming from ailing pain, coming from a life of distain Dressed in heavenly

Before judges they stand, in chains they’d tied their hands Injustice they bore

From all nations, From all tribes, From all people From all nations, From all
tribes, From all tongues (Before the throne stand myriads, of myriads) (2x)
Coming from everywhere

In the furnace they would stroll, in prison as if at home In the spirit they
felt consoled in Christ they were absorbed (They were the ones he saved with the
blood he gave) (2x) I saw them cheering, as they came this way.

From all nations, From all tribes, From all people From all nations, From all

		<title>How Deep</title>
		<content>How deep the Father’s love for us, How
vast beyond all measure That He should give His only Son To make a wretch His
treasure How great the pain of searing loss, The Father turns His face away As
wounds which mar the chosen One, Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross, My sin upon His shoulders Ashamed I hear my mocking
voice, Call out among the scoffers It was my sin that held Him there Until it
was accomplished His dying breath has brought me life I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything No gifts, no power, no wisdom But I will boast in
Jesus Christ His death and resurrection Why should I gain from His reward? I
cannot give an answer But this I know with all my heart His wounds have paid my
ransom

<hymn> <title>Very early Sunday morning</title>
		<content>Very early Sunday
morning While the guards were still asleep Our Lord arose declaring His promise
He did keep. Chorus Resurrection is my song Resurrection gave me life
Resurrection made me strong Jesus my Lord is alive. Jesus is risen in glory
Heaven and earth sang and praised And the angel told the story He is risen as He
said. Mary Magdalene was looking In the garden for her Lord Jesus Himself was
telling Her to go and spread the word. All the disciples were praying They were
truly in great fear When Mary came to them saying He is risen, He is not here.
While they were in the room Jesus Christ Himself appeared My peace I give to you
And My peace with you I leave

But Thomas did not believe What the disciples had seen So Jesus again appeared
Showed him the place of the spear. Tell the Marys to cease mourning Among the
dead do not seek For Jesus our Lord is living Giving power to the weak. Jesus my
victorious Lord Conquered the powers of Hades And the thorn of death He broke My
salvation He proclaims. The heavenly hosts were singing Welcoming our glorious
Lord Heavens joy was overwhelming Jesus opened its doors Alleluia, Alleluia
Risen is the King of peace Alleluia, Alleluia Truly He’s risen indeed Chorus
Resurrection is my song Resurrection gave me life Resurrection made me strong
Jesus my Lord is alive. Jesus is risen in glory Heaven and earth sang and
praised And the angel told the story He is risen as He said.

		<content>Honoured are you Oh St Mark. The pure
disciple and evangelist In your house they held the first Eucharist Your home
became our first church Blessed is your upper room Oh St Mark Where Lord Jesus
gave His covenant He washed and filled the disciples With the Holy spirit
Beholder of God, this is yor name One of the seventy Apostles Selected as
Christ’s disciple You went to preach the Gospel Many were your miracles with the
power of God Your father believed when you shouted OH CHRIST THE SON OF GOD SAVE
US And the lions perished Destroyer of idols You served cities Guided by the
Holy Spirit You found your way to Egypt After preaching in Libya You came to
Alexandria with a torn sandal Faced all the religions and philosophies By the
power of Cod you defeated them With your prayers and pleadings Ananias the
cobbler not knowing Christ Mending your sandals. pierced his thumb To your
delight he screamed saying EIS THEOS. OH THE ONE GOD Blessed are you Ananias
with an open heart Saint Mark taught you about Christ baptized you and you were
made a bishop And the faith spread throughout the land

blessed are you Oh Saint Mark you changed the land Which was full of darkness
and sin To a heavenly paradise With justice shining over it The flourish of
goodness throughout the land Caused the devil to conduct a scheme By stirring
the Romans and Pagans to rise and slay you was their plan With a rope around
your neck you were captured And like Jesus you were tortured You thanked the
Lord for being worthy And the angel appeared saying: Oh Mark the good servant,
the time has come To receive your award Be courageous as your name has been

		<title>My Coptic Church</title>
		<content>My Coptic Church. The church of
the Lord Ancient and Strong, I wish her long life In the early years, After the
birth of Christ St. Mark came bearing, The light of the true faith He dwelt in
the land, proclaiming salvation In the name of our Redeemer, Christ who removed
our sins

The Copts then believed, in the Lord Jesus And Joy filled all the cities of
Egypt In a very very short time, He abolished all idols The cross was exalted,
the sign of the faith Satan quickly rose, to war the Son of God He stirred the
rulers, emperors and armies He then declared war, on the sons of the faith Deny
your Christ, or be thrown in the fire Our honored fathers, elders and youngsters
Were not moved by pain, distress nor dishonor But said courageously, forward no
turning back We don’t fear fire, Our Lord is Jesus Christ

They were beaten and imprisoned, they lived in oppression They were burned and
killed, and tasted every pain By the power of their faith, they overcame their
pains And remained believing in, the King of Peace With blood and suffering,
they bought the faith And preserved it for us, in the name of Our Savior

Let us all rise, from our laziness With diligence seeking, the heavenly rewards
The Church of the Fathers, you are our pride To her success, let us all join
together My Coptic Church, her faith is orthodox Forever strong, Egypt is
Christ’s

		<content>O Thou in whose presence
delighteth my soul And whom in my distress I call My comfort by day and my
refuge by night My stronghold whenever I fall. Shepherd of my soul I beg Thee to
tell Where thou keepest thy sheep to rest For why should I roam in the valley of
tears And wander as one who is lost. I ask thee to tell me daughters of Zion
Have ye seen the One I adore I seek him in vain in the night of my soul But lo!
I can find Him no more.

Shepherd of my soul I shall follow Thee O how sweet Thy voice is to me So guide
me and lead me and show me the way My only desire is Thee. I am my beloved’s and
He is mine too He calleth me sister and spouse O how do I long for the day we
shall wed In heaven in His Father’s house.

Because the Lord is Good I will lift His Name HIGHER Everywhere I go I will lift
His Name x2

who’s left me But my own blackened sin has dimed my path I stumble I am lost and
I am falling And then I see you cry out for my soul I’m about to pierce Your
side with sinful soldiers Then I crumble at Your feet ..it’s me You’ve saved!
Though I wound and scar and dig for you a grave Lord You stand knocking at my
door Till I return just like before

And each time I sin I know that I am spearing you I know sin is what the tears
that wet your cheeks But still I stop and trample out your sweetness All to
taste the bitterness of sin in your defeat Now I’m knocking at Your door Lord do
you hear me? Is it too late for my heart to come to You I am hungry and I’m
thirsty for Your Love Lord I’m weak and now Your sweetness my soul yearns

Will You leave my spirit mourning and lonely? Or will You hear my cry and spare
me from my fate? You said Dear Lord you’d never leave a sinner My sin is the
reason that You came I see clearly now how deeply I have hurt you Now I’ll
pursue Your flawless Devine truth And I shut my eyes and thank You for Your
Mercy My tormented soul Lord You have calmed And I’m warm and safely rested in
Your arms

Nothing special on My own Oh I’ve never walked on water And I have never calmed
a storm Sometimes I’m hiding away from the madness around me Like a child who’s
afraid of the dark

But When I call on Jesus all things are possible I can mount on wings like
eagles’ and soar! When I call on Jesus Mountains are gonna fall ‘cause He’ll
move Heaven and earth to come rescue me when I call

La la la la la la la

Weary brother, broken daughter Little widow mother, you’re not alone If you’re
tired and scared of the madness around you if you cant find the strength to
carry on

When you call on Jesus All things are possible You can mount on wings like
eagles’ and soar! When You call on Jesus Mountains are gonna fall ‘Cause He’ll
move Heaven and earth to come rescue you when you call

Call Him in the Morning!...In the afternoon time! Late in the Evening ...He’ll
be there! When you’re heart is broken!..and you feel discouraged!... You can
just remember...that He’s there...He’ll be there!

When you call on Jesus All things are possible You can mount on wings like
eagles’ and soar! When You call on Jesus Mountains are gonna fall ‘Cause He’ll
move Heaven and earth to come rescue you when you call

When you call on Jesus All things are possible You can mount on wings like

		<title>Everyday</title>
		<content>Everyday Under the cross I’d go and
kneel before you Lord And speak my thoughts Without fear Just like my Father I’d
say my inner feelings there When we’re together

Many times I had the thought Since that day, that when I grow There’s no way I
would get caught And forget Your Cross In my heart I’d always pray That my love
for You remains Not a thing would take away My need to see You My time to talk
to You

As I grew I reached for You But this time my hands were tied With something new
Sadness and fear Were both in me Locked up in sin and lust for a world Vain as
can be

Again that time I had to wonder How to start and sit back under Like the child
who felt that hunger Beneath Your Cross Then again my heart would pray That my
sins you’d wipe away Make my vital wish each day That I would see You To come
and talk to You

When I came I found You Father In Your wings I felt a warmth That’s like no
other You Dried My tears Renewed my soul And The deep regrets I had on You I
poured

I’m a humbled and in awe When I think of what I owe I will walk Your way for
sure Under Your Cross And my heart will sing to You All My life I’ll worship too
From my deepest and my true Love for the Cross…x2 My Love for Your Cross

But ask me why He loves me And I don’t know what to say But i’ll never be the

He’s everything, everything to me

We’re living in uncertain times And more and more I find that i’m aware Of just
how fragile life can be I want to tell the world I found A love that turned my
life around They need to know that they can taste and see Now everyday I’m
praying Just to give my heart away I want live for Jesus So that someone else
might see that He is...

Everything to me He’s more than a story More than words on a page of history
He’s the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet
He’s everything And looking back over my life at the end I’ll go to meet You
saying You’ve been...

Everything to me You’re more than a story More than words on a page of history

Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright

Not because of who I am But because of what You’ve done Not because of what I’ve
done But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the
ocean Vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I’m calling Lord, You catch me
when I’m falling And You’ve told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours

Who am I,that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me
rise again Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through
the rain And calm the storm in me

Not because of who I am But because of what You’ve done Not because of what I’ve
done But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the
ocean Vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I’m calling Lord, You catch me

would have reached down and wiped our tears away, stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen and it’s still raining

as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you”
and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes
away.

And I’ll praise you in this storm and I will lift my hands for You are who You
are no matter where I am and every tear I’ve cried You hold in your hand You
never left my side and though my heart is torn I will praise You in this storm

I remember when I stumbled in the wind You heard my cry to You and raised me up
again my strength is almost gone how can I carry on if I can’t find You

as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you”
and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes
away.

I lift my eyes onto the hills where does my help come from? My help comes from
the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth I lift my eyes onto the hills where does
my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth
