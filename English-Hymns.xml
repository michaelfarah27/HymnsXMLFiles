		<title>Do Not Judge</title>
		<content>"Judge not, that you be not judged." (Matthew 7:1)
That's what our Lord has said (x2)
In His teaching on the mountain
Where He sat and gave His sermon.
He taught us not to judge. (x2)
Yes, He taught us not to judge (x2)

"Jesus went into the temple" (John 8:1-11)
All the people came to Him;
The scribes brought to Him a woman
Whom they caught in the very act. (x2)
Moses' law says she should be stoned, (x2)
Now You tell us what do You think? (x2)

Jesus in sorrow stooped down,
Wrote with His finger on the ground; (x2)
They continued asking Him,
He raised Himself and said one thing:
He who is without a sin,
Let him first cast a stone. (x2)

None of them could raise an eye;
All in shame had a secret sigh. (x2)
They went out one by one,
All of them old and young,
They all left, all went out
As though each could see his sin. (x2)

They left the woman all alone,
Christ asked her in a gentle tone:
"Has no one condemned you?"
She said, no one, none at all.
He said to her, "Neither do I,
Go and sin no more." (x2)

Jesus Christ didn't condemn a sinner,
How can you, the sinner, be a condemner? (x3)
Of your brother's eye you want to remove the speck
Out of your own won't you remove the plank? (Matthew 7:5)</content>

		<title>Coptic New Year's Song</title>
		<content>Welcome, welcome, welcome back
Coptic new year's day.
You remind us of martyrs
Sacrificing all the way.
Gave up the world, the whole world
For the sake of Christ.
Their lives were an oblation
For Him who died.

For the sake of Christ, for the sake of Christ,
Gave up the world, the whole world
For the sake of Christ.

With hope, sincere love,
By prayers and faith,
They offered their lives
To the King of Peace.
Neither life nor money meant a thing
Beauty nor big name nor any other thing.

For the sake of Christ…

They loves Jesus Christ
And welcomed death,
They became our history's
Glorious wealth.
Some of them even sacrificed life and died
Faithfulness to our Lord Christ cannot hide.

For the sake of Christ…

Undivided faith
As a solid mustard seed,
Unconquered love
As strong as death
Could only withstand trials and pain,
And consider death to the world a real gain.</content>

If Satan comes to divide us
Jesus' voice will gather us
And His peace will be with us
We live in peace with our Savior (x2)

Our fathers followed Jesus light
Fought the evil day and night
And received crowns of light
They live in peace with our Savior (x2)</content>

		<title>A Shepherd's Story</title>
		<content>In the fields, near a brook,
We watched over the flock,
The bleating filled the air.
Daytime or at night,
In mind and within sight,
The Thoughts of the True Good Shepherd.

In the silent of the night,
We shivered with fright
When the glory of the Lord shone around
And the angel's saying
Brought us the good tidings:
Christ is born in the City of David.

A big multitude
Of Heavenly host
Was also suddenly seen.
All were praising
The Lord and saying:
Glory to God in the highest.

Let's go and see
That great mystery
The Lord made known to us.
There was the sign,
A Babe in a manger
Glory, Glory, Glory.</content>

Echoing their joyous strains.

Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

		<content>He who overcomes shall eat from the tree of life,
The tree in the midst of our Lord's paradise.

Be faithful until death
And I will give you the crown of life.
Soon I come, soon I come, soon I come as a thief,
And I will give him who thirsts from the water of life.

He who overcomes and keeps My works till the end,
I will give power to rule nations with an iron rod.

Be faithful until death…

He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death;
His name, his name before My Father I confess.

Be faithful until death…

He who overcomes I will write on him My new Name,
He who overcomes shall sit with Me on My Throne.

Be faithful until death…</content>

Naught be all else to me,
Save that Thou art.

Nor man's empty praise.
Thou mine inheritance,
Now and always.

First in my heart.
High King of Heaven,
My Treasure Thou art.</content>

		<title>Because He Lives</title>
		<content>God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal, and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove
My Savior lives.

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory
And I'll know He lives.
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow…</content>

		<title>Breath of Heaven</title>
		<content>I have travelled, many moonless nights,
Cold and weary, with a babe in sight.
And I wonder what I've done,
Holy Father You have come,
And chosen me now, to carry Your son.

I am waiting, in a silent prayer,
I am frightened, by the load I bear.
In a world as cold as stone,
Must I walk this path alone,
Be with me now, be with me now.

Breath of heaven, hold me together,
Be forever near me, Breath of heaven.
Breath of heaven, lighten my darkness,
Pour over me Your Holiness,
For You are Holy, Breath of heaven.

Do you wonder, as You watch my face,
If a wiser one, should have had my place.
But I offered, all I am,
For the mercy of Your plan.

Help me be strong,
Help me be …
Help me…</content>

Then go in peace, and laugh on Glory's side, and
Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus

Bearing fruits of every sort,
And the crops they yield.</content>

		<title>God Gave His Son</title>
		<content>I know Christ died that all might live
That all men might be free.
But do I think to tell myself
That Jesus died for me?

"Hosanna to the Lord of Hosts",
with all the rest I cried.
But I was too the first to say:
"He must be crucified".

And from my mouth came spit so vile
that trickled down His brow.
I screamed those angry mocking words
I taunted with the crowd.

Mine was the hand that held the nail
that bit through bone and flesh.
I rammed the cross into the ground
I gave Him up to death.

Oh mine dear Lord
mine was the guilt, mine was the load of pain.
You carried right to Calvary
That I might live again.

I see the love-marks on You now,
Your hands, Your feet, Your side.
I know Lord 'twas my lack of love
that had You crucified.

There's nothing I can do my Lord,
To pay back what you've done.
But I need your forgiveness Lord.
Lord, to your feet I come.

Lord I believe You died for me
To save me from my sin.
I'm sorry Lord for all I've done
Come cleanse me now within.

I praise you for your gift of grace
that I can never earn.
Lord, I don't want to sin again.
O help me Lord to learn.</content>

Like one of the lilies who nothing possessed,
The care of our Lord is well expressed:
He surely loves, He surely protects.

Food and shelter his mercies provide,
To all animals tame and wild,
In harmony they lived at one time inside,
Eden where Adam used to abide.

In his glory Solomon wasn't dressed…

If we know how to be kind to the poor,
If we care every weak soul,
Abundance and joy and guess how much more,
Would our Good Lord bestow on us all!

I showed you my love on the cross

How miserable I'd be?

As long as I shall live!

If not for His mercy and love
As He had died for me,
I would have been in deep despair
With no hope for repair.

So I owe Him my thanks and praise…

If the Son of God loved me not
How helpless I would be?
He freed me from the deadly bonds
Of sin and slavery.

		<title>In Christ Alone</title>
		<content>In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save:
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
Our Salvation was satisfied -
For every sin on Him was laid;
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath.
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.</content>

Near the Cross, O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me,
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows over me.

In the Cross, in the Cross…

Near the Cross I watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Far from my prayers, far from my cry

Into your hands we commend our hearts
For we must die to ourselves in loving you
Into your hands we commend our love

Our fathers trusted and delivered them
To you they cry, and they escaped
In you they trusted when darkness came their way
And in your goodness you made them free

Into your hands…

You've been my guide since I was very young
You showed the way when I needed someone's hand
But now I'm lonely, nobody is at my side
Stay near my Lord, and be my friend.

		<content>O Thou in whose presence delighteth my soul
And whom in my distress, I call.
My comfort by day, and my refuge by night
My stronghold, whenever I fall.

Shepherd of my soul, I beg Thee to tell
Where Thou makest Thy sheep to rest?
For why should I roam in the valley of tears,
And wander, as one who is lost?

I charge thee to tell me daughters of Zion
Have you seen the One I adore?
I seek Him in vain in the night of my soul
But lo, I can find Him no more

Shepherd of my soul, I shall follow Thee
O how sweet Thou voice is to me!
So guide me, and lead me, and show me the way
My only desire is Thee

I am my Beloved's and He is mine
He calleth me sister and spouse
O how do I long for the day we shall wed
In heaven, in His father's house</content>

Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way

Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in his righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the Throne.

All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry

Oh what needless pain we bear

Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden?
Cumbered with a load of care
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Do thy friends despise, forsake thee
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou will find a solace there.</content>

Would care to know my name,
Would care to feel my hurt.
Who am I, that the Bright and
Morning Star,
Would choose to light the way,
For my ever-wandering heart.

Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done

But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who I am
I am Yours

Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love
and watch me rise again
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me

Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading…</content>

With the waves crashing down
Will you call His name?

My Lord is the God of all creation.

Can you stand against the wind
With your faith, your only anchor
Will you hold your head high
Or will you choose to deny?

Who can this be, who can this be…

If the mountain is in your way
With your faith you can remove it
He planted the seed
You must sow it to see.

Who can this be, who can this be…</content>

To be still and know

Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now, I see. T’was Grace that taught... my heart to fear.

Through many dangers, toils and snares... we have already come. T’was Grace that brought us safe thus far... and Grace will lead us home. 

The Lord has promised good to me... His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be... as long as life endures.  

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease, I shall possess within the veil, a life of joy and peace. 

When we’ve been here ten thousand years... bright shining as the sun. We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise... then when we’ve first begun.  

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me.... I once was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now, I see.</content>

		<title>How Deep The Fathers's Love For Us</title>
		<content>How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom</content>

The Bakerwoman took the road which led to Bethlehem the house of bread. To knead the bread she laboured through the night, and brought it forth about midnight. Bake us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

She baked the bread for thirty years by the fire of her love and the salt of her tears, by the warmth of her heart so tender and bright, and the bread was golden brown and white. Bring us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

After thirty years the bread was done. It was taken to the town by her only son; the soft white bread to be given free to the hungry people of Galilee. Give us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

For thirty coins the bread was sold, and a thousand teeth so cold, so cold tore it to pieces on a Friday at noon when the sun turned black and red the moon. Break us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

And when she saw the bread so white, the living bread she had made at night, devoured as wolves might devour a sheep, the bakerwoman began to weep. Weep for the bread, Mary Mary, Weep for the bread we need to be fed.  

But the bakerwoman's only son appeared to his friends when three days had run on the road which to Emmaus led, and there she knew him in the breaking of bread. Lift up your head, Mary Mary. Lift up your head for now we've been fed.</content>

		<title>How Great Thou Art</title>
		<content>O Lord my God!
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all
The worlds Thy hands have made.
I see the stars;
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed:

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art.

When through the woods
And forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur.
And hear the brook
And feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul…

And when I think
God his Son not sparing.
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross,
My burden gladly bearing;
He bled and died
To take away my sin.

Then sings my soul…</content>

		<content>May my prayer like incense rise before You* M'm lifting up my hands as sacrifice Oh Lord Jesus turn Your eyes upon me For I know there is mercy in Your sight  Your statutes are my heritage forever My heart is set on keeping your decrees So still my anxious urge toward rebellion And let love keep my will on its knees
		
Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You  
		
To all creation I can see a limit But Your commands are boundless and have none So Your Word is my joy and meditation From the rising to the setting of the sun  

All Your ways are loving and are faithful The road is narrow but Your burden light Because You gladly lean to lead the humble I shall gladly kneel to leave my pride 

Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You  

I will seek You in the morning I will look to walk in Your ways And step by step You'll lead me And I will follow You all of my days</content>

		<title>Who am I</title>
		<content>Who am I to be part of Your people 
The ones that are called by Your Name
Could I be chosen as one of Your own? 
Could it be that our blood is the same? 
How can a stranger, a remnant of nations Belong to the Royal line? 
You showed Your grace When the branches were broken
And I was grafted into the vine 

(Blessed be the Name of the Lord) (x4)

How could You show me such bountiful mercy 
By taking the life of the Lamb? 
Your love is grater than I can imagine
I love You with all that I am 
Praise to You Jesus, the veil has been parted 
And what was once secret is known 
Now I can cry to You Father my Father 
And praise You as one of Your Own</content>

		<title>At The Cross</title>
		<content>Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail You
I know You love me

Your holy presence
Surrounding me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Your Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now (x2) 

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done (x2)

And when the earth fades 
Falls from my eyes 
And You stand before me 
I know You love me 
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now (x2) 

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done (x4)</content>

		<title>Find Me</title>
		<content>I’m lost in the wilderness A state I’ve carved from own I’ve hidden my existence Not knowing where I belong 
		
We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy  

Lands and fields surround me I walk before I run Lord be quick to find me The end has now begun 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy.  

We stand fast in Your Holy Law Feeling safe wherever we’re led Sure of Your love and grave As You’re our Daily Bread 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy.  

I hear war, I see violence, Spreading across the seas The masterpiece created Begs for it all to cease 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy. 

I pray, For love to abound For faith to be found For grace to surround</content>

		<content>I know that it’s not You my Lord who’s left me But my own blackened sin has dimed my path I stumble I am lost and I am falling And then I see you cry out for my soul I’m about to pierce Your side with sinful soldiers 
		
Then I crumble at Your feet ..it’s me You’ve saved! Though I wound and scar and dig for you a grave Lord You stand knocking at my door Till I return just like before  

And each time I sin I know that I am spearing you I know sin is what the tears that wet your cheeks But still I stop and trample out your sweetness All to taste the bitterness of sin in your defeat Now I’m knocking at Your door Lord do you hear me? Is it too late for my heart to come to You I am hungry and I’m thirsty for Your Love Lord I’m weak and now Your sweetness my soul yearns  

Will You leave my spirit mourning and lonely? Or will You hear my cry and spare me from my fate? You said Dear Lord you’d never leave a sinner My sin is the reason that You came I see clearly now how deeply I have hurt you Now I’ll pursue Your flawless Devine truth And I shut my eyes and thank You for Your Mercy My tormented soul Lord You have calmed And I’m warm and safely rested in Your arms</content>

Weary brother, broken daughter Little widow mother, you’re not alone If you’re tired and scared of the madness around you if you cant find the strength to carry on

Call Him in the Morning!...In the afternoon time! Late in the Evening ...He’ll be there! When you’re heart is broken!..and you feel discouraged!... You can just remember...that He’s there...He’ll be there!

		<title>Everyday</title>
		<content>Everyday Under the cross I’d go and kneel before you Lord And speak my thoughts Without fear Just like my Father I’d say my inner feelings there When we’re together  
		
Many times I had the thought Since that day, that when I grow There’s no way I would get caught And forget Your Cross In my heart I’d always pray That my love for You remains Not a thing would take away My need to see You My time to talk to You  

As I grew I reached for You But this time my hands were tied With something new Sadness and fear Were both in me Locked up in sin and lust for a world Vain as can be  

Again that time I had to wonder How to start and sit back under Like the child who felt that hunger Beneath Your Cross Then again my heart would pray That my sins you’d wipe away Make my vital wish each day That I would see You To come and talk to You  

When I came I found You Father In Your wings I felt a warmth That’s like no other You Dried My tears Renewed my soul And The deep regrets I had on You I poured  

I’m a humbled and in awe When I think of what I owe I will walk Your way for sure Under Your Cross And my heart will sing to You All My life I’ll worship too From my deepest and my true Love for the Cross… (x2) My Love for Your Cross </content>

When I wake up, at the break of day, Out of bed I get up, to start the day, I clasp my hands together and say: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran. 

After a full day of play, I come to the dinner table with the food on my plate. And before the food gets cold, I lift my eyes and thank the Lord, For the meal of this day, I lift my heart to pray, and say: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran..  

And as I come to end the day, I close my bedroom door to pray. And every night down on my knees, I throw my cares down at Your feet. And I feel Your real (Your real) Joy and Love You share, As I pray the Lord’s Prayer: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran.  

Our Father Who art in heaven, Hallowed and honoured be Thy name.

		<title>Shine On</title>
		<content>See the brightly shining star, As its radiance beams afar, Guide the feet of weary pilgrims To the place where Jesus lay. Like a beacon from its height, Burning brightly in the night, As the wise men followed onward, Safely guided all the way. 
		
Shine on! shine on! Beautiful star of light; Shine on! shine on! Cheering the gloomy night; Shine on! shine on! Sending thy rays afar, Shine on thro’ the darkness, Oh, thou fairest star.

It is shining still for thee, With a glory fair to see, As it leadeth ever upward To the palace of the King. So we follow thro’ the night, Safely guided by its light, While our hearts respond with gladness To the song the angels sing.  

Shine on! shine on! Beautiful star of light; Shine on! shine on! Cheering the gloomy night; Shine on! shine on! Sending thy rays afar, Shine on thro’ the darkness, Oh, thou fairest star.

So today that star alone Is the light to lead us on To the feet of Christ our Savior, He our Prophet, Priest and King, As it brightly burns above, Sentry of the King of love, While we follow onward, upward And His praises sweetly sing.  
 
Shine on! shine on! Beautiful star of light; Shine on! shine on! Cheering the gloomy night; Shine on! shine on! Sending thy rays afar, Shine on thro’ the darkness, Oh, thou fairest star.</content>

Do snarling waves thy craft assail? Art pow’rless, drifting with the gale? Take heart! God’s Word shall never fail. “Sail on! Sail on! Sail on!”

		<title>Butterfly Song</title>
		<content>If I were a butterfly, I'd thank you Lord for giving me wings, 
And If I were a robin in a tree, I'd thank you Lord, that I could sing. 
And If I were a fish in the sea, I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child. 
And I just thank you Father for making me me.  

If I were an elephant, I'd thank you Lord, by raising my trunk, 
And if I were a kangaroo, you know I'd hop right up to you, 
And if I were and octopus, I'd thank you Lord for my fine looks, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child.
And I just thank you Father for making me me.  
 
If I were a wiggly worm, I'd thank you Lord, that I could squirm. 
And if I were a billy goat, I'd thank you Lord, for my strong throat,
And if I were a fuzzy wuzzy bear, I'd thank you Lord for my fuzzy wuzzy hair, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child. 
And I just thank you Father for making me me.</content>

		<title>A Beautiful Life</title>
		<content>Each day I’ll do a golden deed, By helping those who are in need; My life on earth is but a span, And so I’ll do the best I can.  
		
Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		
To be a child of God each day, My light must shine along the way; I’ll sing His praise while ages roll, And strive to help some troubled soul. 

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		
The only life that will endure, Is one that’s kind and good and pure; And so for God I’ll take my stand, Each day I’ll lend a helping hand.  

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		 
I’ll help someone in time of need, And journey on with rapid speed; I’ll help the sick and poor and weak, And words of kindness to them speak. 

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		 
While going down life’s weary road, I’ll try to lift some trav’ler’s load; I’ll try to turn the night to day, Make flowers bloom along the way.

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  </content>

		<title>A Debtor To Mercy Alone</title>
		<content>A debtor to mercy alone, Of covenant mercy I sing, Nor fear, with God's righteousness on, My person and off'rings to bring. The terrors of law and of God With me can have nothing to do; My Savior's obedience and blood Hide all my transgressions from view.  
		
The work which His goodness began, The arm of His strength will complete; His promise is Yea and Amen, And never was forfeited yet. Things future, nor things that are now, Not all things below or above, Can make Him His purpose forego, Or sever my soul from His love.  

My name from the palms of His hands Eternity will not erase; Imprest on His heart, it remains In marks of indelible grace. Yes! I to the end shall endure, As sure as the earnest is giv'n; More happy, but not more secure, When all earthly ties have been riv'n.</content>

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Come, ere the shadows lengthen, Bring Him thy burdened heart; Come where His grace may strengthen, Come from thy cares apart.  

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Smiles of His love await thee, Lighting His lovely face; Just to behold His beauty, Dwell in the secret place.  

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Boldly we may approach Him, Mercy and grace to own; Tempted like us, He bid us Come to the Father’s throne.

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  </content>

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The rich man in his castle, The poor man at his gate, He made them, high or lowly, And ordered their estate.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The purple headed mountains, The river running by, The sunset and the morning That brightens up the sky.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The cold wind in the winter, The pleasant summer sun, The ripe fruits in the garden, He made them every one.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The tall trees in the greenwood, The meadows where we play, The rushes by the water, To gather every day.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell How great is God Almighty, Who has made all things well.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  </content>

		<title>At Calvary</title>
		<content>Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was crucified, Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
		
Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.
		
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned; Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned, Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.  

Now I’ve given to Jesus everything, Now I gladly own Him as my King, Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!  

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary. 

Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan! Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!  

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.  </content>

Yes, we’ll gather at the river, The beautiful, the beautiful river; 

Ere we reach the shining river, Lay we every burden down; Grace our spirits will deliver, And provide a robe and crown.  

Yes, we’ll gather at the river, The beautiful, the beautiful river; 

At the smiling of the river, Mirror of the Savior’s face, Saints, whom death will never sever, Lift their songs of saving grace.

Yes, we’ll gather at the river, The beautiful, the beautiful river; 

Soon we’ll reach the silver river, Soon our pilgrimage will cease; Soon our happy hearts will quiver With the melody of peace.

Crown Him, ye morning stars of light, Who fixed this floating ball; Now hail the strength of Israel’s might, and crown Him Lord of all. Now hail the strength of Israel’s might, and crown Him Lord of all.  

Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God, who from His altar call; Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod, and crown Him Lord of all. Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod, and crown Him Lord of all.  Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race, ye ransomed from the fall, Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all. Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him the virgin’s Son, the God incarnate born, Whose arm those crimson trophies won which now His brow adorn; Fruit of the mystic rose, as of that rose the stem; The root whence mercy ever flows, the Babe of Bethlehem.  

Crown Him the Son of God, before the worlds began, And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man; Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast, And takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.  

Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave, And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save. His glories now we sing, Who died, and rose on high, Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.  

Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise. His reign shall know no end, and round His piercèd feet Fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.  

Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side, Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified. No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight, But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.  

Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, enthroned in worlds above, Crown Him the King to Whom is given the wondrous name of Love. Crown Him with many crowns, as thrones before Him fall; Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, for He is King of all.  

Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign, Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain, Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.  

Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time, Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou has died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.</content>

Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul he leadeth, And where the verdant pastures grow With food celestial feedeth. 

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, But yet in love he sought me, And on his shoulder gently laid, And home rejoicing brought me.  

In death's dark vale I fear no ill With thee, dear Lord, beside me; Thy rod and staff my comfort still, Thy cross before to guide me.  

Thou spread'st a table in my sight; Thy unction grace bestoweth; And O what transport of delight From thy pure chalice floweth!  

And so through all the length of days Thy goodness faileth never: Good shepherd, may I sing thy praise Within thy house for ever.</content>

Take my heart, it is Thine own; it shall be Thy royal throne.

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known. 

He speaks, and the sound of His voice, Is so sweet the birds hush their singing, And the melody that He gave to me Within my heart is ringing.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known. 

I’d stay in the garden with Him Though the night around me be falling, But He bids me go; through the voice of woe His voice to me is calling.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known. </content>

Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on When we shall be forever with the Lord. When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

At the sign of triumph Satan’s host doth flee; On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory! Hell’s foundations quiver at the shout of praise; Brothers lift your voices, loud your anthems raise.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Like a mighty army moves the church of God; Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod. We are not divided, all one body we, One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

What the saints established that I hold for true. What the saints believèd, that I believe too. Long as earth endureth, men the faith will hold, Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane, But the church of Jesus constant will remain. Gates of hell can never gainst that church prevail; We have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng, Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song. Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King, This through countless ages men and angels sing. 

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.</content>

		<title>A Sinner Forgiven</title>
		<content>To the hall of the feast came the sinful and fair; 
She heard in the city that Jesus was there; 
Unheeding the splendor that blazed on the board,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord, 
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord. 

The frown and the murmur went round thro’ them all, 
That one so unhallowed should tread in that hall; 
And some said the poor would be objects more meet, 
As the wealth of her perfume she shower’d on His feet, 
As the wealth of her perfume she shower’d on His feet.  

She heard but the Savior; she spoke but with sighs; 
She dared not look up to the heaven of His eyes; 
And hot tears gushed forth at each heave of her breast, 
As her lips to His sandals were throbbingly pressed; 
As her lips to His sandals were throbbingly pressed.  
In the sky, after tempest, as shineth the bow, 
In glance of the sunshine, as melteth the snow, 

He looked on that lost one: “her sins were forgiv’n,” 
And the sinner went forth in the beauty of Heav’n; 
And the sinner went forth in the beauty of Heav’n.</content>

		<content>If you stub your toe when you get out of bed And you slip in the shower and you knock your head If you miss your breaky and your bike tyre's flat If your dog eats your lunch and you step on the cat  
		
Remember the Lord, Oh-Oh Remember that he is in control Remember the Lord, Oh-Oh He's watching his children 
He cares, Oh-Oh Remember the Lord, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh  If you get to school about a half hour late And	
the principal meets you at the gate If you cant remember 1 plus 2 
And you're busted for something you didn't do  

If your Dad is crusty and your mum's in a flap 
And you spill the custard in your sister's lap 
If you're sent to bed and you don't know why 
And you cant get to sleep and you just want to cry  

Well if you're hitting the skids and you're up the creek If you're down and out and things look bleak If you're in the pits and you're out for a duck If you're long in the tooth and short of a buck</content>

		<title>Abide With Me</title>
		<content>The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me.  
		
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day; Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou who changest not, abide with me. 

Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word; But as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord, Familiar, condescending, patient, free. Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.  Come not in terrors, as the King of kings, But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings, Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea— Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.  

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile; And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile, Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee, On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.  I need Thy presence every passing hour. 

What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power? Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be? Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.  I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. 

Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still, if Thou abide with me. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes; Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies. Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee; In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</content>

		<title>Ave Maria</title>
		<content>Ave Maria! blessed Maid! Lily of Eden's fragrant shade! Who can express the love that nurtured thee, so pure and sweet, making thy heart a shelter meet for Jesus' holy Dove!  
		
Ave Maria! Mother blest, to whom, caressing and caressed, clings the eternal Child; favoured beyond Archangels' dream, when first on thee with tendered gleam thy new-born Savior smiled.  
		
Thou wept'st meek Maiden, Mother mild., thou wept'st upon thy sinless Child, thy very heart was riven: and yet, what mourning matron here would deem thy sorrows bought too dear by all on this side heaven!  

A Son that never did amiss, that never shamed his Mother's kiss, nor crossed her fondest prayer: e'en from the Tree he deigned to bow for her his agonized brow, her, his sole earthly care.  

Ave Maria! thou whose name all but adoring love may claim, yet may we reach thy shrine; for he, thy Son and Savior, vows to crown all lowly lofty brows with love and joy like thine.</content>

		<title>Battle Hymn of the Republic</title>
		<content>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.  
		
I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.  

I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel; “As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal”; Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel, Since God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.  

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.  

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me: As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;  While God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.  

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave, He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave; So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave, Our God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.</content>

		<title>Be Not Afraid</title>
		<content>“Be not afraid, ’tis I, ’tis I, Though the storm rages wild; In thy sore need I’m passing by, Off’ring to help thee, hear thy cry— Be of good cheer, My child.”  
		
“Be not afraid, ’tis I, Be not afraid, ’tis I”; Though wild winds blowing, My bark o’erflowing, God rules in earth and sky;

“Be not afraid, ’tis I, Be not afraid, ’tis I”; The storm can’t harm my trusting soul, For Jesus walks the waves that roll; His voice I hear, which calms my fear, “ ’Tis I, be not afraid.”  

Be not afraid, ’mid pressing foes, Jesus is watching near; He all thy deepest sorrow knows, Walked every step thy pathway goes; Trust Him, then; do not fear.  

Be not afraid, He knows thy heart, And He doth care for thee; Of all thy grief He shares a part, Stands by thy side, He’ll not depart, If thou wilt faithful be.  

Be not afraid, O helpless one, Trust in His boundless grace; Say from the heart, “Thy will be done, Finish the work Thou hast begun, Bring me to see Thy face.”</content>

		<title>Day by Day</title>
		<content>Day by day, and with each passing moment, Strength I find, to meet my trials here; Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment, I’ve no cause for worry or for fear. He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure Gives unto each day what He deems best— Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil with peace and rest.  
		
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me With a special mercy for each hour; All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me, He Whose Name is Counselor and Power; The protection of His child and treasure Is a charge that on Himself He laid; “As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,” This the pledge to me He made.  

Help me then in every tribulation So to trust Thy promises, O Lord, That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation Offered me within Thy holy Word. Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, Ever to take, as from a father’s hand, One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, Till I reach the promised land.</content>

Glory to His Name, glory to His Name: There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name! 
		
I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within; There at the cross where He took me in; Glory to His Name!  

Glory to His Name, glory to His Name: There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name! 

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, I am so glad I have entered in; There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean; Glory to His Name!  

Glory to His Name, glory to His Name: There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name! 

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet; Plunge in today, and be made complete; Glory to His Name!  

Glory to His Name, glory to His Name: There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name! </content>

		<title>His Eye is on the Sparrow</title>
		<content>Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come, Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home, When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
		
I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.  

“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear, And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears; Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.  

I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.  

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise, When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies, I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.  

I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.   </content>

		<title>Love Lifted Me</title>
		<content>I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore, Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more, But the Master of the sea, heard my despairing cry, From the waters lifted me, now safe am I. 
		
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help Love lifted me!  

All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I’ll cling In His blessèd presence live, ever His praises sing, Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul’s best songs, Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs.  

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help Love lifted me!  

Souls in danger look above, Jesus completely saves, He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves. He’s the Master of the sea, billows His will obey, He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.  

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help Love lifted me!  </content>

Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale, Yet will I fear no ill; For Thou art with me, and Thy rod And staff my comfort still.  

My table Thou hast furnished me In presence of my foes; My head Thou dost with oil anoint, And my cup overflows.

		<title>Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus</title>
		<content>O soul, are you weary and troubled? No light in the darkness you see? There’s a light for a look at the Savior, And life more abundant and free!  
		
Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.  

Through death into life everlasting He passed, and we follow Him there; Over us sin no more hath dominion— For more than conquerors we are!  

Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.  

His Word shall not fail you—He promised; Believe Him, and all will be well: Then go to a world that is dying, His perfect salvation to tell!  

Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.  </content>

And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? 

And did the countenance divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

And was Jerusalem builded here Among those dark satanic mills?  

Bring me my bow of burning gold! Bring me my arrows of desire! Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold! Bring me my chariot of fire! I will not cease from mental fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, Till we have built Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land.</content>

Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee, Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see; Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise, Thou mine Inheritance, now and always: Thou and Thou only, first in my heart, High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

Not the labor of my hands Can fulfill Thy law’s demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone.  

Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to the cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Savior, or I die.  

While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyes shall close in death, When I soar to worlds unknown, See Thee on Thy judgment throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee</content>

All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heaven reflect Thy rays, Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise. Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea, Singing bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in Thee.  

Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed, Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest! Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are Thine; Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.  

Mortals, join the happy chorus, which the morning stars began; Father love is reigning o’er us, brother love binds man to man. Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife, Joyful music leads us Sunward in the triumph song of life.</content>

		<title>It Is Well With My Soul</title>
		<content>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll; Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  
		
It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control, That Christ has regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul.  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! My sin, not in part but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live: If Jordan above me shall roll, No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait, The sky, not the grave, is our goal; Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord! Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll; The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, Even so, it is well with my soul.  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.</content>

		<title>In The Garden</title>

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  

He speaks, and the sound of His voice, Is so sweet the birds hush their singing, And the melody that He gave to me Within my heart is ringing.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  

I’d stay in the garden with Him Though the night around me be falling, But He bids me go; through the voice of woe His voice to me is calling.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  </content>

Just a closer walk with Thee, Grant it, Jesus, is my plea, Daily walking close to Thee, Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

When my feeble life is o’er, Time for me will be no more; Guide me gently, safely o’er To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

There let the way appear, steps unto Heav’n; All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given; Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee.  

Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  

Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise; So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.

There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest, There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest; Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee.

		<title>The Old Rugged Cross</title>
		<content>On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, The emblem of suffering and shame; And I love that old cross where the dearest and best For a world of lost sinners was slain.  
		
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, Has a wondrous attraction for me; For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above To bear it to dark Calvary.  

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, A wondrous beauty I see, For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, To pardon and sanctify me.  

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true; Its shame and reproach gladly bear; Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away, Where His glory forever I’ll share. 

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. </content>

		<title>To God Be The Glory</title>
		<content>To God be the glory, great things He has done; So loved He the world that He gave us His Son, Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, And opened the life gate that all may go in.  
		
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, To every believer the promise of God; The vilest offender who truly believes, That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.  

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  

Great things He has taught us, great things He has done, And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son; But purer, and higher, and greater will be Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  </content>

		<title>The Holy City</title>
		<content>Last night I lay a-sleeping There came a dream so fair, I stood in old Jerusalem Beside the temple there. I heard the children singing, And ever as they sang, Me thought the voice of angels From heaven in answer rang.  
		
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing, Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna to your King!  And then me thought my dream was changed, The streets no longer rang, Hushed were the glad Hosannas The little children sang. The sun grew dark with mystery, The morn was cold and chill, As the shadow of a cross arose Upon a lonely hill.  

Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Hark! How the angels sing, Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna to your King!  And once again the scene was changed; New earth there seemed to be; I saw the Holy City Beside the tideless sea; The light of God was on its streets, The gates were open wide, And all who would might enter, And no one was denied. No need of moon or stars by night, Or sun to shine by day; It was the new Jerusalem That would not pass away.  

Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Sing for the night is o'er! Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna for evermore!</content>

		<title>Fight The Good Fight</title>
		<content>Fight the good fight with all thy might; Christ is thy Strength, and Christ thy Right; Lay hold on life, and it shall be Thy joy and crown eternally.  
		
Run the straight race through God’s good grace, Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face; Life with its way before us lies, Christ is the Path, and Christ the Prize.  

Cast care aside, upon thy Guide, Lean, and His mercy will provide; Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove Christ is its Life, and Christ its Love.  Faint not nor fear, His arms are near, He changeth not, and thou art dear. Only believe, and thou shalt see That Christ is all in all to thee.</content>

		<title>Jesus Paid It All</title>
		<content>I hear the Savior say, “Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.”  
		
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

For nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, I’ll wash my garments white In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

And now complete in Him My robe His righteousness, Close sheltered ’neath His side, I am divinely blest. 

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone, Can change the leper’s spots And melt the heart of stone. 

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

When from my dying bed My ransomed soul shall rise, “Jesus died my soul to save,” Shall rend the vaulted skies.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete, I’ll lay my trophies down All down at Jesus’ feet.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</content>

		<content>Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature, O Thou of God and man the Son, Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, Thou, my soul’s glory, joy and crown.

Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight, And all the twinkling starry host; Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer Than all the angels heaven can boast.  

All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly, Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee; None can be nearer, fairer or dearer, Than Thou, my Savior, art to me.  Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations! Son of God and Son of Man! Glory and honor, praise, adoration, Now and forever more be Thine.</content>

		<title>As The Thunder Rolls</title>
		<content>I was sure by now,God, You would have reached down and wiped our tears away, stepped in and saved the day. But once again, I say amen and it’s still raining  as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you” and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.  
		
And I’ll praise you in this storm and I will lift my hands for You are who You are no matter where I am and every tear I’ve cried You hold in your hand You never left my side and though my heart is torn I will praise You in this storm 

I remember when I stumbled in the wind You heard my cry to You and raised me up again my strength is almost gone how can I carry on if I can’t find You  as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you” and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.  

I lift my eyes onto the hills where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth I lift my eyes onto the hills where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth  

And I’ll praise you in this storm and I will lift my hands for You are who You are no matter where I am and every tear I’ve cried You hold in your hand You never left my side and though my heart is torn I will praise You in this storm </content>
