		<content>Refrain
We are called, we are chosen.
We are Christ for one another.
We are promised to tomorrow,
while we are for him today.
We are sign, we are wonder.
We are sower, we are seed.
We are harvest, we are hunger.
We are question, we are creed.

1. Then where can we stand justified?
In what can we believe?
In no one else but he who suffered,
nothing more than he who rose.
Who was justice for the poor.
Who was rage against the night.
Who was hope for peaceful people.
Who was light.

2. Then how are we to stand at all,
this world of bended knee?
In nothing more than barren shadows.
No one else but he could save us.
Who was justice for the poor.
Who was rage against the night.
Who was hope for peaceful people.
Who was light.

3. Then shall we not stand empty
at the altar of our dreams:
When he promised us ourselves.
Who mark time against tomorrow.
Who are justice for the poor.
Who are rage against the night.
Who are hope for peaceful people.
Who are light.</content>

		<title>O Mary</title>
		<content>O Mary, Lady of virgins, you attained greatness, from the True Light, You were exalted, by the Lord Himself, you bore the Creator, O what a great marvel!

Wondrous among nations, wisdom to rulers, a hidden gem, and the gospel spoke of you: They give you blessings, in all generations, O daughter of Joachim, exalted above the Cherubim.

You attained what no one could, O Mother of the Mercy, and you became, filled with grace, To the Divine you became, a veil for the Word, and greatly marveled, were you among the scholars.

O tabernacle of the covenant, O censer of Aaron, O spirit of glory, O daughter of Zion, O the light of eyes, with you we rejoice, and abide in grace, O full of grace.

O full of grace, the fortifying fortress, the jewel of mercy, the aid of the poor, Your son has purged death, O the intercessor of saints, intercede for us, O Mother of Mercy.

Hail to you, O Lady of virgins, O daughter of Joachim, the chosen throne, Righteous is your Son, He purged our shame, the glorious God, the Creator of ages.

The adornment of virgins, the holy Mother, the purity of the pure, O light of lights, O jewel of grace, O Mother of Mercy, truly you are the vine, filled and bearing fruit.

O daughter of Joachim, you attained greatness, you are Jerusalem, glorious and honored, You are Zion, O precious jewel, you released the captive, from the Deceiver’s hand.

Your son saved Adam, the repentant sinner, humanity He set free, from all adversaries, The Lord from your childhood, witnessed your purity, and therefore has blessed you, before all nations.

He sent you Gabriel, the Messenger of His words, and greeted you saying, “The Lord has chosen you, His Holy Spirit, filled and dwelt within you, blessed are you O Virgin, throughout all ages."

The Unseen and Holy, was born from you, and was called Jesus, for all eyes to see, Moses saw the bush, blazing with fire, its branches flaming, yet the bush was not consumed.

The blazing bush, which Moses had seen, was indeed Mary, the adornment of virgins, The fire is Jesus, the Holy Lord, who gave us the Law, engraved in stone.

Isaiah prophesied, about the birth, of Emmanuel, the Almighty King, Ezekiel saw a door, through which the Lord entered, He sealed the door and claimed it, highly exalted.

Highly exalted are you, and your Son Jesus, when He was born of you, the earth was adorned, And also Daniel, prophesied and said, “I saw the high throne, highly exalted.

In the firmaments high I saw, one like the Son of Man, who has dominion, over all the earth, He is the Lord of Hosts, around Him are the ranks, thousands and myriads, glorifying in reverence.”

O daughter of Joachim, you are exalted above, the Cherubim and Seraphim, and all righteous fathers, The Lord was born from you, and David praises you, with his harp he sings, playing its ten strings.

The sound of the first string, is in honor of your name, the Virgin will carry, the Almighty King, And with the second string, David rejoices, chanting with hymns, while playing his harp.

And the third O daughter, because you were faithful, you were filled with light, and the Lord chose you, The fourth string is sounded, so that all can hear, of her who is praised, all over the world.

The fifth is a sign of hope, as a dove she appears, with Ophir gold, upon her shoulders, With the sixth he sung, praises I will not hide, but I will praise with him, and proclaim to all.

With the seventh string he said, O mountain of the High God, the High took flesh from you, without a doubt, And with the eighth he sang, to the Virgin Mary, the Great chose her, and crowned her with honor.

With the ninth string he said, from her will surely come, God her son, who sealed her virginity, With the tenth he sang, the Powerful God, in Zion he appeared, the dwelling of the righteous.

There isn’t in all ages, anyone like you O Virgin, for you released the chains, and shame of Adam, O Lady of the creation, the pride of faith, your servant is in need, drowning because of sins.

Intercede for me, do not leave your servant, ask your son to save me, from the fire, For your intercession, is heard and accepted, and He defends from the attacks, of the adversary.

Arise O poor one, and clothe yourself in faith, and say Amen Amen, for us she intercedes, The persistent servant, will always praise her, for by his side that Day, the Lady of virgins shall be.</content>

		<title>Do You Hear What I Hear</title>
		<content>Said the night wind to the little lamb,
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite."

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea."

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace walls, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold--
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold."

Said the king to the people everywhere,
"Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light."</content>

		<title>The Wedding Banquet</title>
		<content>Chorus:
I cannot come to the banquet, I cannot come to the banquet,
don't trouble me now.
I have married a wife; I have bought me a cow.
I have fields and commitments that cost a pretty sum.
Pray, hold me excused, I cannot come.

A certain man held a feast on his fine estate in town.
He laid a festive table and wore a wedding gown.
He sent invitations to his neighbours far and wide
but when the meal was ready, each of them replied:

The master rose up in anger, called his servant by name,
said: "Go into the town, fetch the blind and the lame,
fetch the peasant and the pauper, for this I have willed,
my banquet seem so crowded, and my table must be filled.
When all the poor had assembled, there was still room to spare,
so the master demanded: "Go search every where,
to the highways and the byways and force them to come in.
My table must be filled before the banquet can begin.

Now God has written a lesson for the rest of the mankind;
If we're slow a responding, he may leave us behind.
He's preparing a banquet for that great and glorious day
when the Lord and Master calls us, be certain not to say:</content>

		<title>In the Midst of the Raging Sea</title>
		<content>In the Midst of the Raging Sea,
There I was sailing.
The waves were pounding me,
Making me afraid.
(And it seems, That Christ has left me,) x2
(But I no longer see him because of my weak faith) x2

Refrain:
Jesus when he saw me,
Came to me quickly.
In my despair and darkness,
He opened my eyes.
(When I saw him, I cried have mercy)x2
(He came to me quickly and had mercy on me) x2

The sounds of the angry waves, 
Agonized my ears.
Darkness of the creeping night,
Has threatened my peace.
(And the tears, have not left my eyes)x2
(And the sleepless nights, have overwhelmed me) x2

Refrain:
Jesus when he saw me,
Came to me quickly.
In my despair and darkness,
He opened my eyes.
(When I saw him, I cried have mercy)x2
(He came to me quickly and had mercy on me) x2

I took the oar and started rowing,
But my hopes have failed
My weakness and my ignorance,
Brought more grief to me.
(And my Lord, at the shore sees me) x2
(When will you come to me, and restore my hope?) x2

Refrain:
Jesus when he saw me,
Came to me quickly.
In my despair and darkness,
He opened my eyes.
(When I saw him, I cried have mercy)x2
(He came to me quickly and had mercy on me) x2

I was in despair and drowning,
And my hope is torn.
I came to my beloved Jesus,
Offering him my tears.
(When he saw me, He had compassion on me) x2
(He stretched out his sweet hand, and dried my tears) x2</content>

Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Refrain:
Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
Oh, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!</content>

		<title>Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</title>
		<content>Come, thou Fount of every blessing, 
tune my heart to sing thy grace; 
streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
call for songs of loudest praise. 
Teach me some melodious sonnet, 
sung by flaming tongues above. 
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it, 
mount of thy redeeming love. 

Here I raise mine Ebenezer; 
hither by thy help I'm come; 
and I hope, by thy good pleasure, 
safely to arrive at home. 
Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
wandering from the fold of God; 
he, to rescue me from danger, 
interposed his precious blood. 

O to grace how great a debtor 
daily I'm constrained to be! 
Let thy goodness, like a fetter, 
bind my wandering heart to thee. 
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, 
prone to leave the God I love; 
here's my heart, O take and seal it, 
seal it for thy courts above. </content>

		<title>Footprints on the Water</title>
		<content>When I was a little fish, swimming happily
I heard the sound of footsteps
Walkin on the sea
I swam up to the surface
And much to my surprise
There on top of the water
Right before my eyes

I saw footprints on the water
Footprints on the sea
Footprints on the water
And I could not believe
I saw Jesus, Jesus
Walking on the waves
Footprints on the water that day

Then a man named Peter
Stepped out on the waves
He tried to walk to Jesus
Then, he sank away
This is how it happened I heard Jesus say take courage in his eye so don’t be afraid 

I saw footprints on the water
Footprints on the sea
Footprints on the water
And I could not believe
I saw Jesus, Jesus
Walking on the waves
Footprints on the water that day

It was a Miracle

Shadowing me like a tree.
We sing our psalms together,
We share praises and prayer.

He takes me under his wing.
Alerts me when I go wrong,
And helps me to stay as strong.
This is my angel, my angel,
This is my guardian angel.

When at home, he's there
Blessing every little corner;
He is happy when we care,
Love each other and spare.

Teaches me to be thankful,
Helps me to remain faithful,
Oh, he is so wonderful.

Holy, holy, holy is my church

When I was a little baby
Only 40-days old
Both mom and dad took me
To church with great joy
Abouna dipped me in deep water
Thrice in the name of the Trinity
This was my Baptism
By which I was born anew.

Holy, holy, holy is my church…

Gradually I grew up
On her nourishing teachings
In the Sunday school
With my friends and siblings
Every time I go I taste
More and more of God's love
This is my bigger family
That prepared me for communion.

Holy, holy, holy is my church…

Best of all is her
Afkharistia Sacrament
When we pray the Liturgy
And celebrate the Eucharist
I get the Blood and Body
Of my Lord Emmanuel
I'm in Him and He's in me
Like the branch is in the tree.

And the light of my homeland Egypt
With a flaming love in my heart,
I adore you Orthodox faith.

Mother of the martyrs is beautiful,
Mother of the honorable is noble
She crossed the sea of all sufferings,
She preserved with her blood the faith.

O Mother your love made me alive,
Your pain is the seed of my faith
You went through the worst of times,
And you got out of them victorious.

Your enemies struck you and hurt you,
They've put you in jails and have killed you
As food for beasts they made you,
And to every pain exposed you.

O Mother how faithful you were,
And love of your bridegroom filled you
His sacraments He gave you,
And by his power you are garded.

How beautiful is my wounded Mother,
For the sake of the savior and His servants
Blessed is he who will love you,
Who will preserve your faith.

I hope my heart starts to love you,
So that i would live your faith
And chase away your enemies,
Renewing your old days.

O Mother here i come,
Your love boiling in my viens
I promise with all my heart,
I shall serve my Father's church.</content>

		<title>The Burning Bush</title>
		<content>The Burning Bush seen by Moses The prophet in the wilderness
The fire inside it was aflame But never consumed or injured it

The same with the Theotokos Mary Carried the fire of Divinity
Nine months in her holy body Without blemishing her virginity

I open my mouth and proclaim And utter hidden mysteries
Praising saint Virgin Mary Blessed is the pride of the human race

Because of your Son we became Free from the bondage of the evil place
And from Satan's bonds we are saved Blessed is the pride of the human race!

Gabriel the messenger came to you With the incarnation of the Logos
The Lord will dwell in your holy womb Blessed is the pride of the human race

The Holy Spirit will come upon you The Most High will overshadow you
And you shall bear the Son of God Blessed is the pride of the human race

The Burning Bush seen……

His Holy Spirit came upon you And took from you the humanity
A true human you did carry Blessed is the pride of the human race

He saved Adam and his children And cured them from the serpents venom
And he returned him to Paradise Blessed is the pride of the human race

David your father spoke of you And prophesied about the birth
The God of gods became your Son Blessed is the pride of the human race

You became a Mother of Your Creator For the salvation of mankind
He came and dwelt in your womb And your virginity is sealed

The Burning Bush seen……

The Lord of Glory chose your beauty And adorned you with his Divinity
And took from you humanity Blessed is the pride of the human race

A plant sprouting without seed He appeared without watering
In a pure and undefiled field Blessed is the pride of the human race

The righteous fathers did call you The second heaven on earth
The Almighty Lord dwelt in you Blessed is the pride of the human race

Ezekiel witnessed and spoke of you In the east he saw a door
In it entered her Creator And the door was tightly shut

The Burning Bush seen……

Zephaniah proclaiming saying About the coming of the Divine
He will come as rain without clouds Blessed is the pride of the human race

Daniel in a vision saw the Throne Surrounded by hosts of angels
And upon it sat the Holy King Blessed is the pride of the human race

He bowed the heaven of heavens And descended to the earth
While still in His Fathers' bosom Blessed is the pride of the human race

We saw wonders and miracles In the books of the Christian Church
The Virgin held her Creator And her virginity is sealed.

The Burning Bush seen……

You are higher than all ranks And above the heavenly hosts
And also the archangels Blessed is the pride of the human race

He forgave the people their sins He is the Bestower of all good things
He took our form and loved it Blessed is the pride of the human race

You are above all the world And the ranks and the soldiers
And higher than the upright and righteous Blessed is the pride of the human race

All people declare, “She is blessed” Our Lady, Saint Mary
Intercede and pray on our behalf Before Whom you gave birth to

The Burning Bush seen……

You held the Lord of Glory The creator of the world
You resembled with the Throne of the Father Blessed is the pride of the human race

He took from you the humanity Uniting it with the Divinity
You held the One from the Trinity Blessed is the pride of the human race

No one obtained what you received In all the generations
Among the nations and people Blessed is the pride of the human race

We declare saying blessed is she And also praise day and night
To Him Who chose your beauty To dwell and incarnate from you

The Burning Bush seen……

Guide me to repent, O Mary Before time catches with me
To wake from the slumberness of days And to rise from my laziness

I liked to prepare myself before traveling And carry a light load
Help me please, in this void earth Through you, O Lady of us all

For I am lame and have limited effort Yet carry a heavy burden
Time has come to depart this world And I have no refuge but Mary

I say, “Hail to the Mother of Light” Mary, the help of all Christians
Through her, salvation was revealed To all Christendom

The Burning Bush seen……

To protect us from all evil And from the times of temptations
And help us all, in every aspect We the Christian nations

Everyone praise her And ask of her morning and vespers
Before Whom she held in her womb To intercede for us all

		<content>I praise you O pure Virgin, Maria ti-par-thenos,
Your Lord has chosen you, That He may save our souls.

Gabriel came to you with good news, Saying: "Hail to you o Virgin,
O full of grace and joy, The Lord is with you.'

The angelic messenger appeared, Nem epsajee efgo emmos,
Je etis-maro-ot entho khenni-heiome, Efis-maro-ot enje pi-karpos.

He appeared to Mary with joy, And spoke with her,
You will bear and give birth to Emmanuel, The Savior of the World.

The Spirit of God will come upon you, The power of the Highest will overshadow you,
The holy Son of the Highest, Will be born of you.

The lady of creation answered him, "Without a man, how can I bear?
I have not known any man" The angel answered her.

"Your beloved Elizabeth, Advanced in years and days,
Is with child, in the sixth month, Nothing is impossible with the Lord.

With faith, she bore in her womb, The holy Lord dwelt in Mary,
She went quickly to her kinswoman, And entered the house of Zachariah.

When Elizabeth heard, The voice of Mary ti-parthenos,
In her womb did leap, Io-annes pi-eprod-romos.

Mary bore the fire of Divinity, She became the throne,
She carried the Lord of Sabbaoth, Who is worshiped by all the hosts.

Our father Adam disobeyed, Deceived by Satan the evil,
The serpent invaded his thoughts, He obeyed the advice of the Devil.

When he followed the liar, He was exiled out of Paradise,
He disobeyed the Lord of lords, Naked and exposed, He was cast outside.

Adam was afraid and bemused, His mind became confused,
God the Judge had compassion, He incarnated of the virgin.

He saved Adam and his race, And broke the power of Satan,
He released His chosen saints, To Paradise they returned.

He healed us with His gifts, Through Mary the Virgin,
He bestowed His great grace, We became joyful after much distress.

David your father said of you, And explained in the Psalms,
The God of gods appeared from you, The Savior of the world.

You were called the mother of Masias, You exceeded all ranks of ni-angelos,
Isaiah has spoken of you, As you were prophesied about by Amos.

John saw you as a woman, Shining in precious clothes,
Walking above the clouds of heaven, On her head was the sun and stars.

Moses saw you as a bush, Its branches engulfed in flames,
The fire did not consume it, The bush is the mother of Jesus.

Ezekiel saw you as a gate, Towards the east sealed shut,
The God of truth entered in, And exited and it remained shut.

The curse and shame were removed, Through Efnouti pi-Loghos,
You are of the righteous offspring, Owoh ep-thelel enze-keos.

He removed all sadness, And saved all who were captives,
And ended the delusion of Satan, Who became humiliated and defeated.

A heaven and example, you became, O holy without blemish,
Hail to you, joy of all generations, O Mary, Mother of Jesus.

They likened her to a golden censer, Placed in ti-kivotos,
Every tongue praises her, Ti-shelet en-katharos.</content>

		<title>Kiahk (Week 2)</title>
		<content>I begin with the holy name of God, The Word, the Son of God Esos,
In the name of the unapproachable Trinity, Ek-owab ek-owab agios.

Three sanctifications for three Hypostases, One God without division,
I greet Mary the daughter of Joachim, The intercessor for the Christians.

The Lord has chosen, Mary the purest of the pure,
In her, the One of the Trinity, Became flesh in truth.

Gabriel came to Mary, With his greeting and spoke to her,
Announcing to her the greatest mystery, The holy Word will dwell in her.

She was filled with the Holy Spirit, Inside her womb the Son did dwell,
She conceived of the Holy Spirit, While she was a bride and virgin.

The Creator of heaven and earth, Came to us with a great mystery,
He to whom the throne's hosts obey, Dwelled in the womb of the virgin.

This was a great gift from Him, Which He accomplished for Adam's sake,
For the salvation of those in darkness, To bring them back to Paradise.

According to the wise plan, Our Savior's divinity was hidden,
From the evil defiler, Satan the cursed villain.

Satan humiliated Adam with lust, The commandments of God he disobeyed,
He ate the fruit and became naked, He was cast out of Paradise's gate.

Our Master came in human flesh, Which He took from the pride of creation,
He came in and out while the door was sealed, As seen in Ezekiel's revelation.

Ezekiel witnessed in his revelation, And said I saw visions in the East,
A sealed door with locks on it, The holy God has entered through it.

You kept the secret of the great God, You O Mary the daughter of Joachim,
You carried the Creator of all souls, You became the chariot of Cherubim.

God and Man appeared from you, Divinity united with humanity,
And you gave birth to Him in Bethlehem, Magi from the East came to Him joyfully.

The high hosts of the throne, With the shepherds were praising,
"Glory to God in the highest," With their voices they cried singing.

Salvation appeared to the captives, Those who suffered, He liberated,
Adam's descendants were in prison, In darkness with the defiled Satan.

Emmanuel the only-begotten Son, Made Mary a tabernacle and a shield,
Moses, Baslael and Aholiab, Made the tent with gold and precious beads.

God forgave us our sins, Through His great birth He came to us,
He delivered us from our enemies, And gave us the sign of the cross.

Mary has exceeded the archangels, And all the hosts and the powers,
Who among all creatures, Resembles Mary the virgin.

Mary accepted all greetings, From the generous God, the Logos,
The God of all with out beginning, Who is praised by the angels.

All the prophecies were fulfilled, About Mary, they said proverbs,
Moses saw a burning bush among hills, And fire never burnt its branches.

Hail to you O Mother of God, O Mary you became as heaven,
When God clung to your bosom with His hands, You nourished Him O Bride and Virgin.

Who among all creatures, Can describe your great blessings?
When Elizabeth met you, She was with child with the Baptist.

The light of the Creator has illuminated, Steadily to John the Baptist,
He worshiped in her womb three times, To Him in the womb of the virgin.

This is a great hidden mystery, You carried Him O daughter of Zion,
You shamed Satan the villain, By bearing Jesus Christ.

And I the sinner and the negligent, In the commandments of the God of Hosts,
Marcos the patriarch by word, But my acts do not please the Lord.

Do not forget Your people, O Judge who are present everywhere,
We, Your servants, old and young, Protect us from Satan's snares.

O Lord I ask of You, Through the intercessions of the martyrs,
And the saints, the dwellers of the mountains, Cast all evil away from us.

And the peace of the holy God, Be with you all attendants,
Deacons and priests, And all the congregation of Christians.</content>

		<content>A dove appeared in Zachariah's house, When she appeared, she gave peace,
The barren woman came out to meet, The Mother of the Creator.

A second bodily heaven, Mary the throne of the Almighty,
She accepted Gabriel's preaching, The angel announced to her saying.

"You will bear the Creator," He gave a sign to prove to her,
A child for Elizabeth and Zachariah, Although she was barren she will bear.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

She is in her sixth full month, Although she was called, the barren one,
God's promises are wonderful, For Him nothing is impossible.

Then the angel left Mary, So she arose to go and see,
To witness this great pregnancy, She left Nazareth and the city.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The pure dove came as the dew, Of Aermon on the Mount Zion,
A cloud with raindrops and with dew, Which softly came upon Zion.

The Sun of righteousness revealed His light, Carried by the fiery chariot,
He appeared in a city of Judah, And entered the house of Zachariah.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The spiritual Castle dwelt, Its feet are wheels of fire,

Carried the only-begotten One, Eternal Creator life-giving fire.
A dove as Solomon called her, A palm tree with life-giving fruit,

Bringing tidings of peace and comfort, In its wings is our healing.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

A dove is calling in our land, In the land of the dead standing,
Carrying our Redeemer, Transforming earth into heaven.

The servant rejoiced to meet his King, The womb of the barren is His veil,
In the womb of the Virgin He was formed, In the bodily throne but with the Father still.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The Baptist went to meet his Lord, The creation needed the Creator,
He humbled Himself through His great love, He did all things with great splendor.

The barren began to understand, Day embarrassed the night of darkness,
The barren is the night; her light is the moon, The Child is the day and Sun of righteousness.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The all powerful Master, Stretched His hand from the womb,
By His right hand He baptized His servant, And anointed him in His mother's womb.

The servant was astonished, He moved and was filled with joy,
The created worshiped his Creator, And was full of fear and trampled.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

Who is He who grants His gifts, And then asks it of His servant,
It is our God who humbled Himself, Who enriches His servant.

Our Lord baptized His servant John, In the womb He filled him with joy,
Then He asked baptism of him, As if in need, but He is the One who bestows.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

Before the Ark of the Covenant, David rejoiced and danced,
Likewise while Christ was in the womb, John the Baptist rejoiced and danced.

O David play the organ and harp, For mercy and justice did embrace,
Justice has shown from the earth, Mercy is Jesus who came to save.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The elder one heard the peace, Out of the young virgin's lips,
From the mouth of a pure dove, She was filled with the divine grace.

The forerunner saw his Creator's mother, And was filled with grace and wisdom,
He spoke through his mother's mouth, "Blessed are you among women."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

Eve the mother of all the living, Became the mother of all the dead,
When she was cursed for disobedience, To Hades all humanity was led.

Mary was divinely blessed, With the greeting of Gabriel the angel,
All women became blessed by her, And released from the curse and its danger.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

Adam's fall affected all men, The curse, they all inherited,
Through Jesus the exalted Lord, The human race was blessed.

You secured for me all blessing, You came to me mother of my God,
Blessed are you who accepted and believed, That you would be the Mother of God.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

The heart of pure Mary was comforted, With a beautiful voice she was singing,
"My soul magnifies the Lord," She began praising the Lord with thanksgiving.

"My Creator is in my womb, I rejoice in God my Savior,
He beheld my lowly state, I His handmaid and mother."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

"He showed his mercy to all generations, Henceforth they all call me blessed,
The Son of the highest dwelt in my womb, Through me, all symbols are fulfilled."

"The high God performed wonders, Holy is His name in heaven,
His mercies are from generation to generation, His promises to his people given."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

"He made wonders with His strong arm, He brought down the haughty,
He expelled demons from heaven, To seat His people in glory."

"He fed the hungry with goodness, And sent the rich away without compensation,
Empty of all goodness, That they may seek Him for salvation."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

When Rebecca was given to marriage, Her brothers spoke to her saying,
May you increase to thousands upon thousands, May your offspring possess their enemies' dwellings.

Rebecca is gone and now Mary, Spoke the same prophecy and said,
"He removed the proud in their heart, And with the humble replaced them.

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

"His servant Israel, son of Abraham, He strengthened and blessed,
The offspring of the daughter of Joachim, His Lord appeared and exalted."

"My Son, the offspring of Jacob, Abraham and Isaac received the promise,
In my womb dwelt the fearful God, And fulfilled through me all promises."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

Mary dwelt for three month, With Elizabeth her kinswoman,
Until the completion of her time, To give birth to the preacher of baptism.

The elder woman spoke to the young girl, Saying, "Go now in peace,
O fiery chariot of God, On which sat the King of peace."

A dove appeared in Zachariah's house…

How could the handmaiden rest, While her mistress served her,
Depart to your house O holy heaven, With peace the pure virgin returned.

She returned to Nazareth, Olive branch in her mouth like Noah's dove,
She expelled the flood of sin, And preached to us the hidden God.

O You who saved Noah, Your Spirit descended on your disciples,
Through the intercessions of Saint Mary, Keep the gates of the Church open for us.

		<content>O Beloved, O Beloved
I wonder how You feel
Wearing a crown of thorns
Wounded from head to heel

O Beloved, O Beloved
At Your blessed cross I kneel
You were despised and rejected
Wounded for my soul to heal

As I lift my eyes above
In tears I do confess
The wonders of Your love
And my unworthiness

The price of my sins You've paid
As those cruel stripes were made
My heart is torn with grief
As Your side was pierced

I watched those cruel soldiers
Mock, spit and curse Your Name
Vinegar that was so bitter
They gave to quench Your thirst

Lord instead of me You've died
That I might be purified
I know Your precious Blood did flow
To make me whiter than snow

Lord, Your heart is so forgiving
At Your feet I want to stay
Lord, Your cross is life giving
Power to lead me all the way

Lord, Your glorious cross I'll follow
Wherever I may be
Lord, I'll never forget Your sorrow
And Your sufferings for me

O Beloved, O Beloved
Nailed unto the cross for me
O, what sin hast thou committed?
Thou who callest all to be

O Beloved, wish that I could
Spend the rest of my life with Thee
Worshipping Thine holy Passion
Crucifying the flesh for Thee

Daughter of Zion, behold me,
Stricken and smitten for thee
Friend and kin Me have forsaken
There is none to comfort Me

All alone I'll tread the winepress
All alone I'll drink the cup
Shedding My Blood for thee to ransom
And My flesh for thee to sup

I was bound and I was smitten
And they did spit in My face
I was stripped, and I was scourged
I was condemned in Your place

Your sins became My crown of thorns
O that you could understand
Every time you sin anew
It's one more nail in My hand

Like a lamb brought to the slaughter
Like a dumb sheep to be sheered
King, Creator, Lord and Master
By His creatures mocked and jeered

Despised, rejected, with grief acquainted
And of men was not esteemed
Bruised and wounded, sore afflicted
Yet, with His stripes we were healed

Lord, create in us a fountain
That with tears will overflow
And a heart contrite and broken
And the spirit within renew

O that we could shed the tears
Over Thy feet, pierced and bruised
O that we'd always remember
For our sins Thou wert abused</content>

		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

Moses fasted for forty days To be cleansed in body and spirit
To receive from God the two tablets with the Ten Commandments on them write

When Moses saw the almighty God His glory filled Moses with grace
The people of Israel covered their eyes they could not look at his radiant face

Fasting and prayer of the prophet Daniel saved his life in the lions' den
The Lord kept shut the lion's mouth for God protects His holy men

Blessed are those…

Elijah fasted and prayed that the sky for three and a half years would not rain
That the Israelites who went astray would feel hunger, agony, and pain

As they repented he asked the Lord To bring the rain with His mighty hand
The Lord opened the gates of heaven rain and rejoicing filled the land

Fasting and prayers of Nineveh as they appealed to God above
When they repented God forgave their sins and filled them with His love

Blessed are those…

Fasting and prayer of the disciples spread God's word to every nation
Baptizing and preaching the Holy Gospel healing and bringing salvation

Fasting and prayers of the martyrs gave them the power to stand the pain
Knowing that even losing their lives is nothing compared to their heavenly gain

Fasting and prayers of the righteous and cross bearers kept them living
In caves and deserts and mountains because of their love for Christ the king

		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day.

Fasting is steadfastness to the soul, He who fasts shall not fall,
He will be saved from all attacks, The heavenly kingdom, he will not lack.

Seek the kingdom with righteousness, Think not of your garments and fullness,
All these will be to you granted, From God many gifts are handed.

Accord mercy unto all, Do not expect an earthly reward,
It is said, do not worry about tomorrow, Your gains are secure and shall grow.

Blessed are those…

Meditate on the nursing ravens, Creatures without power or opinions,
The Father cares for them, like all animals, You exceed all creation, O prized humans,

Firmly stand in pleading, For mercy in simplicity asking,
As one asking his neighbor in time of need, To lend him three loaves indeed.

Love your enemies, with affection, Care for those who cause you affliction,
Pray for those who abandon you, Forgive your brother seven times his due.

Blessed are those…

Mind the trial on Judgment Day, Give alms and grace will come your way,
For on the merciful descends mercy, Blessed is he who gives abundantly.

Continue for in the final hour, Will rejoice the obedient with power,
But the negligent and lazy, Will fear for his hour will not be easy.

In that day there is great aid, For mercy lessens judgment's fate,
It helps the people of the earth, To the highest, it raises them forth.

Blessed are those…

My Lord said, Seek, you shall find, Ask and you shall be given of all kind,
Knock, it shall be opened unto you, Struggle with mercy those who oppose you.

Deepen your mercy with forgiveness, Pray night and day with humbleness,
Like the tax collector beat your chest, In the liturgies stand meekly to be blessed.

Praise the Lord and exalt Him, Above all and glorify Him,
Raise your hands towards heavens, Our Father who art in heaven.

Blessed are those…

Be a help to those in time of need, The true currency of the heavenly,
So that we may rejoice with the meek, Along with the heavenly sing and speak.

Fast a spiritual fast, From all iniquity, in purity surpassed,
Do not approach any uncleanness, Nor care for the earthy things.

Man's humility brings forth strength, He who loses his life, it he gains,
A seed must die and be buried, So that much fruit will be its yield.

Blessed are those…

Ask Him that He may hear you, Blessed is My Father, come all of you,
Come to see the awaited Kingdom, From the institution of all creation.

Your earthly treasures are easily destroyed, by moth and rust they are made void,
Gather for yourself the heavenly treasures, And make haste for the true riches.

Pray and plead to your Father in secret, He will grant you great wages without regret,
He will count this for your righteousness, With which you will enter into His riches.

Blessed are those…

Abound in tears, your heart soft as flesh, Your covenant with God refresh,
Beware of vainglory's evils, And submitting to the passions.

The world's glory is like a flower, Which withers and fades like thunder,
Your charity offerings remain eternal, Remembered by Him in heaven.

It is said, that secret alms, Is the greatest of all things,
So do not offer with worldly love, Offer prayers to God above.

Blessed are those…

Fasting is precious to the soul, The Lord's way full of holiness,
He who disobeys is Satan's slave, His attacks he shall not waive.

Partake of the Lord's righteousness, Do not neglect His greatness,
As the Fathers fasted to be protected, To the highest degrees they were elevated.

Moses through fasting saw the light, On the mount he saw the God of might,
God gave him the Two Tablets written, The Ten Commandments he was given.

Blessed are those…

Nineveh, when it went astray, By the word of Jonah, it awoke to pray,
And in three days' fasting it stayed, The repentance accepted after dismay.

Elijah was a prophet far away, On the mountain, he did fast and pray,
The Lord took him alive without delay, Into heaven in a fiery sleigh.

To show us the power of fasting always, Our Lord fasted for forty days,
We become to Him a nation everlasting, Acquiring all our needs through fasting.

Blessed are those…

Fasting cannot be without prayer, In humility, in worship, they are a pair,
That our request before Him endure, By alms our fasting is pure.

My heart is grieved, I the sinner, My sins and trespasses I remember,
Pray for me my fathers, I am wicked, I am drowning in my ailment.

My peace from me to you, I the sinner calling to you,
Setting myself before your eyes, Do not forget me in your prayers.

		<title>Sunday of Temptation</title>
		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights
Teaching us to follow in his path and walk in the narrow and righteous way

At last Jesus showed great hunger the tempter came to Him and said
If you are truly the son of God change this stone to a loaf of bread

Jesus said to Satan it is written by bread alone man shall not live
The word of God will fill his needs eternal life the Lord will give

Blessed are those…

The devil took Jesus to the temple and said as you stand in this holy place
If truly you are the son of God throw yourself from here to the base

For God will send His mighty angels to watch over those who are His own
To give protection and support your feet will not touch a single stone

Jesus said to him it is written you should not try to tempt the Lord
For He is your Lord and creator and you cannot withstand His sword

Blessed are those…

Satan become more and more confused if this was the Lord, why would he fast
And wondered if this was the Messiah who came to save the world at last

So he took Him to a high mountain the glory of the world under Him to see
And said all this I shall give to you if you bow down and worship me

Then Jesus said be gone to the devil one shall worship God and not Satan
The devil departed as the angels came to serve the blessed son of man

		<title>Sunday of the Prodigal Son</title>
		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

There was a man who had two sons working with him in the house they grew
After his death all that he had was to be divided between the two

The younger son said to his father give me now my share of what you own
Soon after that he took what he received and went far away to live on his own

He spent his money by living in sin with youth who came to have fun with him
Not long after, he lost all he had the future seemed so gloomy and grim

Blessed are those…

A famine came throughout the land his friends left him when his money was gone
He looked for a job to feed himself for a long time he could not find one

At last he got a job on a pig farm and gladly shared of what the swine ate
Sorrow and pain soon filled his heart lonely and sad he became, what a fate!

He said to himself that was a mistake to leave my loving father at home
I was living in comfort and peace now I am an outcast, the land I roam

Blessed are those…

The servants in my father's house have better food than I to eat
I hardly can live on the swine's' food in my fathers home living was sweet.

I wish I could go now back home and tell him in the past we didn't get along
I sinned against you and heaven I know that I have done you wrong

Please take me back, I beg of you I lost everything with no where to go
Consider me a servant in your home a son I don't deserve to be, I Know

Blessed are those…

When the son left, the father was sad Wondering always what was his son's fate
He was hoping to see him once again For long hours he would sit by the gate

The father saw his son from afar Coming home tired and walking slow
He ran, embraced and hugged his boy And Said, "Come to me, I missed you so"

The son then cried, "I am not worthy I do not deserve in your sight to stand
I sinned against you and heaven Please take me as a hired hand"

Blessed are those…

The father said, "You are my flesh and blood You will always be to me a son"
He ordered for him to get new shoes A ring for his finger, a robe to put on

"A fattened calf we shall eat today Let joy and happiness in this home abound
My son was dead and now is alive To me he was lost, but now is found"

The eldest son, with his father was upset And said to him with eyes full of tears
"You are unfair to your good son You gave me nothing throughout the years”

Blessed are those…

“Your prodigal son wasted his share While I worked for you like a slave
For him a feast you have prepared A goat for my friends you never gave"

The father said, "All I have is yours I appreciate that you are always here
Please understand a father's heart You are both to my heart so dear”

God always calls those who drift and say “My arms to you are open and wide
Even if you're lost and call on Me You will always find me by your side”

		<title>Sunday of the Samaritan Woman</title>
		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

Jesus departed from Judea on His way to Galilee land
He had to pass through Samaria the heat of the sun was hard to stand

He stopped by a city called Sychar and sat down to rest from the heat
In the land that Jacob gave Joseph there lies Jacob's well, at his feet

The disciples, to buy food, went into town a journey ahead, of a whole day to go
Jesus looked up by the well nearby a woman from Samaria coming, He saw

Carrying a pail to draw water with from the well, as she did every day
Jesus asked her if she would give Him water to quench His thirst away

Blessed are those…

She said how can I give you water the Jews and Samaritans don't get along
I am a Samaritan, you are a Jew the Jews have done the Samaritans wrong.

He said if you know about God's gift the one who is asking you for a drink
Is He that gives the living water from giving Him water, you would not shrink.

She looked at Him and said how can you get water when the well is deep
You don't even have a pail to use so where would you, the water keep.

Are you greater than the prophet Jacob who gave this well many years ago
To us to satisfy our needs His greatness and kindness we all know

Blessed are those…

Jesus said from this water you drink after a while you'll thirst again
The water I give to you will be a spring of eternal life for men

The woman said give me of this water that I may not again come here
You utter strange but marvelous things I wish others, to your words, would hear

Jesus said go call your husband to listen to what I have to say
She said to Him, no husband I have and turned her face from Him away

Jesus told her right you have said five husbands you had in the past
The man in your home is not your spouse the truth came from your heart as last

Blessed are those…

She said I see you are a prophet although I do not know, Sir, your name
Tell me which place one should worship here as our fathers said or in Jerusalem

Believe me woman the day will come in the near future Jesus replied
People will not worship the father here, there, or on the mountain side.

You worship what you don't know about but we Jews, worship what we know
The Lord of Salvation from us will come from Him the living water will flow

God is a spirit and those who believe and worship Him in truth and spirit
With them the father will be pleased they shine in heaven and their lamps are lit

The woman said the Messiah will come to show us all things that are and will be
Jesus answered you should know by now the one that you speak with now, is He

Blessed are those…

At that moment the disciples came back and were surprised to see Him talk
To the Samaritan woman by the well as she was starting away to walk

They said to Jesus, Master, eat the food we brought from town to thee
He said my nourishment is not meat but doing the will of Him, who sent me

Isnt it four months til harvest I say lift up your eyes and see
The fields are ripe and ready to be reaped the sower and the reaper, happy both will be

The woman told the people of the town “A man told me all that I have done
He might be the coming Messiah” So all of them at once, to Him were gone

After two days of hearing Him teach And the Word from God they did receive
They told the woman, “For ourselves we saw He is the world's Savior, we truly believe”

		<title>Sunday of the Paralyzed Man</title>
		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

There was a pool in Bethesda Near the great temple in Jerusalem
Where those afflicted stayed near by The blind, the palsied and the lame.

For every now and then to the pool Came an angel from heaven
Moving the water and blessing it Healing power to the water was given.

Whoever gets in first would be healed As soon after the angel came
So all the sick waited by the pool To get in first was each man's aim.

Blessed are those…

A man with illness, thirty-eight years Was seen by Jesus lying in there
Jesus asked him if he wanted to be healed The man said, "I have no friends who care."

Whenever I try to get in the pool Someone will get in before me
I have no strength to move in fast No hope for healing that I can see."

Jesus said, "Get up now and walk You will have strength to carry your bed."
At once, the man was totally healed And did exactly what Jesus said.

Blessed are those…

The Jews then saw the man walking Carrying the bed on which he used to lay
They told him that it was not lawful To carry his bed on a Sabbath day.

The man answered that it was the One Who healed me, ordered me to do so.
"Who is this Man?" they asked him As Jesus moved away, the man didn't know.

Later that day in the temple Jesus said to the man as he walked through
"Now that you are well, sin no more That nothing worse may befall you."

Blessed are those…

The man went back to the Jews and said, "It was Jesus who made me walk."
Persecuting Jesus the Jews then sought Saying the Sabbath commandment He broke.

Jesus then told them, "My Father is still Working in this world and so I do."
That made the Jews even more intent To kill Him as their hate to Jesus grew.

No matter how many years we have A sickness of the body or of the soul
God will forgive if we repent And heal and bless us, one and all.

		<title>Sunday of the Born Blind Man</title>
		<content>Blessed are those who have mercy Who give to the poor and fast and pray
The Holy Spirit will fill their hearts The Son will show them mercy on judgment day

A man who was blind since his birth was seen by the disciples as they passed by
They asked Jesus was it the man's sin or his parents' that he had no eyes

Jesus answered neither is the case but that God through him be glorified
A miracle will be witnessed by all that His holy name be magnified

Jesus said to the man come forward and made of the dust a piece of clay
He touched the man's eyes with it and said “Go to Siloam and wash the clay away”

The man did so and came back seeing his eyes were created in him a new
The crowd was astonished to see the miracle and wondered if it was the same man they knew

Blessed are those…

The Pharisees said to the man is it true that you have been blind since your birth
And that Jesus opened your eyes using clay from the dust of the earth

He told them yes I am the one who was born blind but now can see
A man called Jesus opened my eyes I do confess that he did heal me

Then they said Jesus is a sinner performing miracles on the Sabbath day
The man declared how can this be He is a great prophet, I have to say

They asked his parents is he your son the parents answered he is for sure
But how he sees we do not know he should explain, he is mature

Blessed are those…

The Pharisees again asked how he was healed this made him angry and upset
He said would you be willing to believe if I told you that he is a prophet

They said to the man in sin you were born you try to teach us, how do you dare
We follow Moses of whom we know Jesus we know not, comes from where

They cast him away, rebuking him in Jesus they didn't want to believe
Their eyes were blinded to see the truth the grace of God they did not receive

The simple eye is the body's light it sees the truth, its light always shines
Opening our eyes we ask You Lord honor, majesty, and power are Thine

		<content>Down the Via Dolorosa
In Jerusalem that day,
The soldiers tried to clear the narrow street.
But the crowd pressed in to see
The Man condemned to die on Calvary.

He was bleeding from the beating
There were stripes upon His back,
And He wore a crown of thorns upon his head,
And He bore with every step
The scorn of those who cried out for His death

Down the Via Dolorosa called the “Way of Suffering”
Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King
But He chose to walk that road
Out of his love for you and me
Down the Via Dolorosa all the way to Calvary

The blood that would cleanse
The souls of all men
Made its way to the heart
Of Jerusalem

Down the Via Dolorosa called the “Way of Suffering”
Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King
But He chose to walk that road
Out of his love for you and me
Down the Via Dolorosa all the way to Calvary</content>

Looking at the empty tomb she was in fear

She asked the gardener, “where did they put my Lord?”

Jesus was telling her, “O Mary rejoice”
She cried, “O Master” as she recognized the voice

He told her, “Go to my brothers and preach the news
Tell them I will come and see them very soon”
Mary went to the disciples right away
With all joy she preached, “Jesus is Risen today”

Showed them His hands, His side and gave them peace
For Thomas sake He appeared another time
Told him come, touch me and see My wounded side

Jesus gave him back his sight
A great happiness filled his heart
When he saw the sun so bright
He worshipped the King of Light
In every place he praised His might

Tell me where I can find my beloved phone

Go to my brethren and tell them

Now You tell us what do You think? (x2)

Jesus in sorrow stooped down,
Wrote with His finger on the ground; (x2)
They continued asking Him,
He raised Himself and said one thing:
He who is without a sin,
Let him first cast a stone. (x2)

None of them could raise an eye;
All in shame had a secret sigh. (x2)
They went out one by one,
All of them old and young,
They all left, all went out
As though each could see his sin. (x2)

They left the woman all alone,
Christ asked her in a gentle tone:
"Has no one condemned you?"
She said, no one, none at all.
He said to her, "Neither do I,
Go and sin no more." (x2)

		<title>Coptic New Year's Song</title>
		<content>Welcome, welcome, welcome back
Coptic new year's day.
You remind us of martyrs
Sacrificing all the way.
Gave up the world, the whole world
For the sake of Christ.
Their lives were an oblation
For Him who died.

For the sake of Christ, for the sake of Christ,
Gave up the world, the whole world
For the sake of Christ.

With hope, sincere love,
By prayers and faith,
They offered their lives
To the King of Peace.
Neither life nor money meant a thing
Beauty nor big name nor any other thing.

For the sake of Christ…

They loves Jesus Christ
And welcomed death,
They became our history's
Glorious wealth.
Some of them even sacrificed life and died
Faithfulness to our Lord Christ cannot hide.

For the sake of Christ…

Undivided faith
As a solid mustard seed,
Unconquered love
As strong as death
Could only withstand trials and pain,
And consider death to the world a real gain.</content>

Fought the evil day and night

		<title>A Shepherd's Story</title>
		<content>In the fields, near a brook,
We watched over the flock,
The bleating filled the air.
Daytime or at night,
In mind and within sight,
The Thoughts of the True Good Shepherd.

In the silent of the night,
We shivered with fright
When the glory of the Lord shone around
And the angel's saying
Brought us the good tidings:
Christ is born in the City of David.

A big multitude
Of Heavenly host
Was also suddenly seen.
All were praising
The Lord and saying:
Glory to God in the highest.

Let's go and see
That great mystery
The Lord made known to us.
There was the sign,
A Babe in a manger
Glory, Glory, Glory.</content>

Echoing their joyous strains.

Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy Perfect Light.

Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never

Incense owns a Deity nigh
Pray'r and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God most high.

Breathes of life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.

		<content>Weak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die
O, raise your head, for love is passing by
Come to Jesus, come to Jesus
Come to Jesus and live!

And like a newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl
And remember when you walk, sometimes we fall, so
Fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus and live!

Sometimes the way is lonely, steep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then
Cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus and live!

And with your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye
Then go in peace, and laugh on Glory's side, and
Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live!</content>

When people seem to care less,
No matter how problems press,
Our Lord is there to bless.
And you see His mercies near.

Take the Lord your port and dwelling,
Allow Him to steer the wheel.
Entrust life to Him Who's caring
And don't you worry.

If your faith is sound and true,
When things turn blue,
Jesus Christ is your clue,

The strengths of the sick and poor;
Sacraments are always there,
To help us more and more.

The birds chirp on the trees
Sending His praise.

Pretty flowers toss their heads,
So do the trees.

Bearing fruits of every sort,
And the crops they yield.</content>

		<title>God Gave His Son</title>
		<content>I know Christ died that all might live
That all men might be free.
But do I think to tell myself
That Jesus died for me?

"Hosanna to the Lord of Hosts",
with all the rest I cried.
But I was too the first to say:
"He must be crucified".

And from my mouth came spit so vile
that trickled down His brow.
I screamed those angry mocking words
I taunted with the crowd.

Mine was the hand that held the nail
that bit through bone and flesh.
I rammed the cross into the ground
I gave Him up to death.

Oh mine dear Lord
mine was the guilt, mine was the load of pain.
You carried right to Calvary
That I might live again.

I see the love-marks on You now,
Your hands, Your feet, Your side.
I know Lord 'twas my lack of love
that had You crucified.

There's nothing I can do my Lord,
To pay back what you've done.
But I need your forgiveness Lord.
Lord, to your feet I come.

Lord I believe You died for me
To save me from my sin.
I'm sorry Lord for all I've done
Come cleanse me now within.

I praise you for your gift of grace
that I can never earn.
Lord, I don't want to sin again.
O help me Lord to learn.</content>

Nor reap nor store like men always do,
They fly care free and yet they all know,

In his glory Solomon wasn't dressed,
Like one of the lilies who nothing possessed,
The care of our Lord is well expressed:
He surely loves, He surely protects.

Food and shelter his mercies provide,
To all animals tame and wild,
In harmony they lived at one time inside,
Eden where Adam used to abide.

In his glory Solomon wasn't dressed…

If we know how to be kind to the poor,
If we care every weak soul,
Abundance and joy and guess how much more,
Would our Good Lord bestow on us all!

		<title>If Christ Loved Me Not</title>
		<content>If Jesus Christ loved me not
How miserable I'd be?
The only Son of God saved me
His Blood was shed for me!

So I owe Him my thanks and praise
As long as I shall live!
O my beloved, fill my heart
With heavenly grace and peace.

If not for His mercy and love
As He had died for me,
I would have been in deep despair
With no hope for repair.

So I owe Him my thanks and praise…

If the Son of God loved me not
How helpless I would be?
He freed me from the deadly bonds
Of sin and slavery.

		<title>In Christ Alone</title>
		<content>In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save:
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
Our Salvation was satisfied -
For every sin on Him was laid;
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath.
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.</content>

Near the Cross, O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me,
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows over me.

In the Cross, in the Cross…

Near the Cross I watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Far from my prayers, far from my cry
To you I call, but you never answer me
You send no comfort and I don't know why

Into your hands we commend our spirits O Lord
Into your hands we commend our hearts
For we must die to ourselves in loving you
Into your hands we commend our love

Our fathers trusted and delivered them
To you they cry, and they escaped
In you they trusted when darkness came their way
And in your goodness you made them free

Into your hands…

You've been my guide since I was very young
You showed the way when I needed someone's hand
But now I'm lonely, nobody is at my side
Stay near my Lord, and be my friend.

And when He comes down
With shouts of glory
And our time on earth is done
How I long to hear Him saying,
“Faithful servant, well done.”

O Lord prepare me
To be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I'll be a living

		<title>Shepherd Of My Soul</title>
		<content>O Thou in whose presence delighteth my soul
And whom in my distress, I call.
My comfort by day, and my refuge by night
My stronghold, whenever I fall.

Shepherd of my soul, I beg Thee to tell
Where Thou makest Thy sheep to rest?
For why should I roam in the valley of tears,
And wander, as one who is lost?

I charge thee to tell me daughters of Zion
Have you seen the One I adore?
I seek Him in vain in the night of my soul
But lo, I can find Him no more

Shepherd of my soul, I shall follow Thee
O how sweet Thou voice is to me!
So guide me, and lead me, and show me the way
My only desire is Thee

I am my Beloved's and He is mine
He calleth me sister and spouse
O how do I long for the day we shall wed
In heaven, in His father's house</content>

In the corner of my eye.

Reflected off the sky

Show me Your glory.
Send down Your presence,
I want to see Your face.
Show me Your glory.
Majesty shines about You
I can't go on without You, Lord.

When I climb down the mountain,
And get back to my life,
I won't settle for ordinary things.
I'm going to follow You forever,
And for all of my days.
I won't rest 'til I see You again.

I dare not trust the sweetest frame

All other ground is sinking sand. (x2)

I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.

On Christ the Solid Rock I stand…

His oath, His covenant, His Blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay.

On Christ the Solid Rock I stand…
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in his righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the Throne.

All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer.

Oh what peace we often forfeit
Oh what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so faithful?
Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden?
Cumbered with a load of care
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Do thy friends despise, forsake thee
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou will find a solace there.</content>

Would care to know my name,
Would care to feel my hurt.
Who am I, that the Bright and
Morning Star,
Would choose to light the way,
For my ever-wandering heart.

Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done

But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who I am
I am Yours

Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love
and watch me rise again
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me

Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading…</content>

With the waves crashing down
Will you call His name?

That even the wind and the sea obey Him?
Who can this be, who can this be?
My Lord is the God of all creation.

Can you stand against the wind
With your faith, your only anchor
Will you hold your head high
Or will you choose to deny?

Who can this be, who can this be…

If the mountain is in your way
With your faith you can remove it
He planted the seed
You must sow it to see.

To be still and know
That You're in this place
Please let me stay and rest

Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now, I see. T’was Grace that taught... my heart to fear.

Through many dangers, toils and snares... we have already come. T’was Grace that brought us safe thus far... and Grace will lead us home. 

The Lord has promised good to me... His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be... as long as life endures.  

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease, I shall possess within the veil, a life of joy and peace. 

When we’ve been here ten thousand years... bright shining as the sun. We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise... then when we’ve first begun.

I saw them thanking, as they came this way  From all nations, From all tribes, From all people From all nations, From all tribes, From all tongues 

(Before the throne stand myriads, of myriads) (x2) 

Coming from everywhere  In the furnace they would stroll, in prison as if at home In the spirit they felt consoled in Christ they were absorbed 

(They were the ones he saved with the blood he gave) (x2) 

I saw them cheering, as they came this way.  From all nations, From all tribes, From all people From all nations, From all tribes, From all tongues 

(Before the throne stand myriads, of myriads) (x2)

Coming from everywhere  They were hated and Despised, their lives remained in strife their peace was not destroyed, for praising gave them joy 

(They were the ones he saved with the blood he gave) (x2) 

I saw them victorious as they came this way</content>

		<title>How Deep The Fathers's Love For Us</title>
		<content>How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom</content>

		<title>The Baker Woman</title>
		<content>The Bakerwoman in her humble lodge received a grain of wheat from God. For nine whole months the grain she stored Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Make us the bread Mary Mary we need to be fed.  

The Bakerwoman took the road which led to Bethlehem the house of bread. To knead the bread she laboured through the night, and brought it forth about midnight. Bake us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

She baked the bread for thirty years by the fire of her love and the salt of her tears, by the warmth of her heart so tender and bright, and the bread was golden brown and white. Bring us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

After thirty years the bread was done. It was taken to the town by her only son; the soft white bread to be given free to the hungry people of Galilee. Give us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

For thirty coins the bread was sold, and a thousand teeth so cold, so cold tore it to pieces on a Friday at noon when the sun turned black and red the moon. Break us the bread Mary, Mary we need to be fed.  

And when she saw the bread so white, the living bread she had made at night, devoured as wolves might devour a sheep, the bakerwoman began to weep. Weep for the bread, Mary Mary, Weep for the bread we need to be fed.  

But the bakerwoman's only son appeared to his friends when three days had run on the road which to Emmaus led, and there she knew him in the breaking of bread. Lift up your head, Mary Mary. Lift up your head for now we've been fed.</content>

They were beaten and imprisoned, they lived in oppression They were burned and killed, and tasted every pain By the power of their faith, they overcame their pains And remained believing in, the King of Peace With blood and suffering, they bought the faith And preserved it for us, in the name of Our Savior

		<title>How Great Thou Art</title>
		<content>O Lord my God!
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all
The worlds Thy hands have made.
I see the stars;
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed:

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art.

When through the woods
And forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur.
And hear the brook
And feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul…

And when I think
God his Son not sparing.
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross,
My burden gladly bearing;
He bled and died
To take away my sin.

Then sings my soul…</content>

The ones that are called by Your Name
Could I be chosen as one of Your own? 
Could it be that our blood is the same? 
How can a stranger, a remnant of nations Belong to the Royal line? 
You showed Your grace When the branches were broken
And I was grafted into the vine 

(Blessed be the Name of the Lord) (x4)

How could You show me such bountiful mercy 
By taking the life of the Lamb? 
Your love is grater than I can imagine
I love You with all that I am 
Praise to You Jesus, the veil has been parted 
And what was once secret is known 
Now I can cry to You Father my Father 
And praise You as one of Your Own</content>

		<title>At The Cross</title>
		<content>Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail You
I know You love me

Your holy presence
Surrounding me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Your Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now (x2) 

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done (x2)

And when the earth fades 
Falls from my eyes 
And You stand before me 
I know You love me 
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now (x2) 

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done (x4)</content>

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy  

Lands and fields surround me I walk before I run Lord be quick to find me The end has now begun 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy.  

We stand fast in Your Holy Law Feeling safe wherever we’re led Sure of Your love and grave As You’re our Daily Bread 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy.  

I hear war, I see violence, Spreading across the seas The masterpiece created Begs for it all to cease 

We cry, We mourn, We beg for Your mercy, They laugh, They scorn, They teach the world hypocrisy.

Then I crumble at Your feet ..it’s me You’ve saved! Though I wound and scar and dig for you a grave Lord You stand knocking at my door Till I return just like before  

And each time I sin I know that I am spearing you I know sin is what the tears that wet your cheeks But still I stop and trample out your sweetness All to taste the bitterness of sin in your defeat Now I’m knocking at Your door Lord do you hear me? Is it too late for my heart to come to You I am hungry and I’m thirsty for Your Love Lord I’m weak and now Your sweetness my soul yearns  

Will You leave my spirit mourning and lonely? Or will You hear my cry and spare me from my fate? You said Dear Lord you’d never leave a sinner My sin is the reason that You came I see clearly now how deeply I have hurt you Now I’ll pursue Your flawless Devine truth And I shut my eyes and thank You for Your Mercy My tormented soul Lord You have calmed And I’m warm and safely rested in Your arms</content>

Call Him in the Morning!...In the afternoon time! Late in the Evening ...He’ll be there! When you’re heart is broken!..and you feel discouraged!... You can just remember...that He’s there...He’ll be there!

		<title>Everyday</title>
		<content>Everyday Under the cross I’d go and kneel before you Lord And speak my thoughts Without fear Just like my Father I’d say my inner feelings there When we’re together  
		
Many times I had the thought Since that day, that when I grow There’s no way I would get caught And forget Your Cross In my heart I’d always pray That my love for You remains Not a thing would take away My need to see You My time to talk to You  

As I grew I reached for You But this time my hands were tied With something new Sadness and fear Were both in me Locked up in sin and lust for a world Vain as can be  

Again that time I had to wonder How to start and sit back under Like the child who felt that hunger Beneath Your Cross Then again my heart would pray That my sins you’d wipe away Make my vital wish each day That I would see You To come and talk to You  

When I came I found You Father In Your wings I felt a warmth That’s like no other You Dried My tears Renewed my soul And The deep regrets I had on You I poured  

I’m a humbled and in awe When I think of what I owe I will walk Your way for sure Under Your Cross And my heart will sing to You All My life I’ll worship too From my deepest and my true Love for the Cross… (x2) My Love for Your Cross </content>

When I wake up, at the break of day, Out of bed I get up, to start the day, I clasp my hands together and say: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran. 

After a full day of play, I come to the dinner table with the food on my plate. And before the food gets cold, I lift my eyes and thank the Lord, For the meal of this day, I lift my heart to pray, and say: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran..  

And as I come to end the day, I close my bedroom door to pray. And every night down on my knees, I throw my cares down at Your feet. And I feel Your real (Your real) Joy and Love You share, As I pray the Lord’s Prayer: Je Penniot et khen nifi-owi mareftovo enje Pekran.  

Our Father Who art in heaven, Hallowed and honoured be Thy name.

Shine on! shine on! Beautiful star of light; Shine on! shine on! Cheering the gloomy night; Shine on! shine on! Sending thy rays afar, Shine on thro’ the darkness, Oh, thou fairest star.

It is shining still for thee, With a glory fair to see, As it leadeth ever upward To the palace of the King. So we follow thro’ the night, Safely guided by its light, While our hearts respond with gladness To the song the angels sing.  

Shine on! shine on! Beautiful star of light; Shine on! shine on! Cheering the gloomy night; Shine on! shine on! Sending thy rays afar, Shine on thro’ the darkness, Oh, thou fairest star.

So today that star alone Is the light to lead us on To the feet of Christ our Savior, He our Prophet, Priest and King, As it brightly burns above, Sentry of the King of love, While we follow onward, upward And His praises sweetly sing.

And If I were a robin in a tree, I'd thank you Lord, that I could sing. 
And If I were a fish in the sea, I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child. 
And I just thank you Father for making me me.  

If I were an elephant, I'd thank you Lord, by raising my trunk, 
And if I were a kangaroo, you know I'd hop right up to you, 
And if I were and octopus, I'd thank you Lord for my fine looks, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child.
And I just thank you Father for making me me.  
 
If I were a wiggly worm, I'd thank you Lord, that I could squirm. 
And if I were a billy goat, I'd thank you Lord, for my strong throat,
And if I were a fuzzy wuzzy bear, I'd thank you Lord for my fuzzy wuzzy hair, 
but I just thank you Lord for making me me. 

For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile. 
You gave me Jesus and you made me your child.

		<title>A Beautiful Life</title>
		<content>Each day I’ll do a golden deed, By helping those who are in need; My life on earth is but a span, And so I’ll do the best I can.  
		
Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		
To be a child of God each day, My light must shine along the way; I’ll sing His praise while ages roll, And strive to help some troubled soul. 

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		
The only life that will endure, Is one that’s kind and good and pure; And so for God I’ll take my stand, Each day I’ll lend a helping hand.  

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		 
I’ll help someone in time of need, And journey on with rapid speed; I’ll help the sick and poor and weak, And words of kindness to them speak. 

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  
		 
While going down life’s weary road, I’ll try to lift some trav’ler’s load; I’ll try to turn the night to day, Make flowers bloom along the way.

Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.  </content>

		<title>A Debtor To Mercy Alone</title>
		<content>A debtor to mercy alone, Of covenant mercy I sing, Nor fear, with God's righteousness on, My person and off'rings to bring. The terrors of law and of God With me can have nothing to do; My Savior's obedience and blood Hide all my transgressions from view.  
		
The work which His goodness began, The arm of His strength will complete; His promise is Yea and Amen, And never was forfeited yet. Things future, nor things that are now, Not all things below or above, Can make Him His purpose forego, Or sever my soul from His love.  

My name from the palms of His hands Eternity will not erase; Imprest on His heart, it remains In marks of indelible grace. Yes! I to the end shall endure, As sure as the earnest is giv'n; More happy, but not more secure, When all earthly ties have been riv'n.</content>

		<title>A Call To Prayer</title>
		<content>Softly the evening vespers Hallow the closing day; Sweetly the Savior whispers, “Come to the throne and pray.”  
		
Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Come, ere the shadows lengthen, Bring Him thy burdened heart; Come where His grace may strengthen, Come from thy cares apart.  

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Smiles of His love await thee, Lighting His lovely face; Just to behold His beauty, Dwell in the secret place.  

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  

Boldly we may approach Him, Mercy and grace to own; Tempted like us, He bid us Come to the Father’s throne.

Softly I hear Him calling, Calling at close of day; Sweetly His tones are falling, “Come to the throne and pray.”  </content>

		<content>All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
Each little flower that opens, Each little bird that sings, He made their glowing colors, He made their tiny wings. 

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The rich man in his castle, The poor man at his gate, He made them, high or lowly, And ordered their estate.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The purple headed mountains, The river running by, The sunset and the morning That brightens up the sky.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The cold wind in the winter, The pleasant summer sun, The ripe fruits in the garden, He made them every one.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
The tall trees in the greenwood, The meadows where we play, The rushes by the water, To gather every day.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  
		
He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell How great is God Almighty, Who has made all things well.  

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The Lord God made them all.  </content>

		<title>At Calvary</title>
		<content>Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was crucified, Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
		
Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.
		
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned; Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned, Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.  

Now I’ve given to Jesus everything, Now I gladly own Him as my King, Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!  

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary. 

Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan! Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!  

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.  </content>

Ere we reach the shining river, Lay we every burden down; Grace our spirits will deliver, And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river, Mirror of the Savior’s face, Saints, whom death will never sever, Lift their songs of saving grace.

Yes, we’ll gather at the river, The beautiful, the beautiful river; 

Soon we’ll reach the silver river, Soon our pilgrimage will cease; Soon our happy hearts will quiver With the melody of peace.

Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race, ye ransomed from the fall, Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all. Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him the virgin’s Son, the God incarnate born, Whose arm those crimson trophies won which now His brow adorn; Fruit of the mystic rose, as of that rose the stem; The root whence mercy ever flows, the Babe of Bethlehem.  

Crown Him the Son of God, before the worlds began, And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man; Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast, And takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.  

Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave, And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save. His glories now we sing, Who died, and rose on high, Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.  

Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise. His reign shall know no end, and round His piercèd feet Fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.  

Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side, Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified. No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight, But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.  

Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, enthroned in worlds above, Crown Him the King to Whom is given the wondrous name of Love. Crown Him with many crowns, as thrones before Him fall; Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, for He is King of all.  

Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign, Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain, Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.  

Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time, Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou has died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.</content>

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, But yet in love he sought me, And on his shoulder gently laid, And home rejoicing brought me.  

In death's dark vale I fear no ill With thee, dear Lord, beside me; Thy rod and staff my comfort still, Thy cross before to guide me.  

Thou spread'st a table in my sight; Thy unction grace bestoweth; And O what transport of delight From thy pure chalice floweth!

		<title>Onward Christian Soldiers</title>
		<content>Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before. Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe; Forward into battle see His banners go!  
		
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

At the sign of triumph Satan’s host doth flee; On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory! Hell’s foundations quiver at the shout of praise; Brothers lift your voices, loud your anthems raise.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Like a mighty army moves the church of God; Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod. We are not divided, all one body we, One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

What the saints established that I hold for true. What the saints believèd, that I believe too. Long as earth endureth, men the faith will hold, Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane, But the church of Jesus constant will remain. Gates of hell can never gainst that church prevail; We have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.  

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.  

Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng, Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song. Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King, This through countless ages men and angels sing.

		<title>We Plough The Fields And Scatter</title>
		<content>We plough the fields and scatter The good seed on the land, But it is fed and watered By God's almighty hand: He sends the snow in winter, The warmth to swell the grain, The breezes and the sunshine, And soft, refreshing rain.  
		
All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above; Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord, For all his love.  

He only is the maker Of all things near and far; He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star; The winds and waves obey him, By him the birds are fed; Much more to us, his children, He gives our daily bread. 

We thank thee then, O Father, For all things bright and good, The seed time and the harvest, Our life, our health, our food. Accept the gifts we offer For all thy love imparts, And what thou most desirest, Our humble, thankful hearts.  

All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above; Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord, For all his love.  </content>

		<content>Sabbath day of rest and cheer! Day divine, to me so dear! Come, O come to old and young, Gath’ring all for prayer and song.
		
Now the week of toil is o’er, And in peace we sit once more At our Father’s ample board, Listening to His gracious Word. 
		
Lord, our God, we seek Thy face, Bless us with Thy saving grace; May Thy heralds everywhere Clear Thy Gospel truth declare.  

Let Thy mighty Word hold sway Over men on earth today; Our poor souls, good Shepherd, feed, Into pastures green us lead.  

May, O Lord, the day be near, When we pass from trials here Into Thine eternal rest, In the mansions of the blest.</content>

		<title>A Sinner Forgiven</title>
		<content>To the hall of the feast came the sinful and fair; 
She heard in the city that Jesus was there; 
Unheeding the splendor that blazed on the board,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord, 
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord. 

The frown and the murmur went round thro’ them all, 
That one so unhallowed should tread in that hall; 
And some said the poor would be objects more meet, 
As the wealth of her perfume she shower’d on His feet, 
As the wealth of her perfume she shower’d on His feet.  

She heard but the Savior; she spoke but with sighs; 
She dared not look up to the heaven of His eyes; 
And hot tears gushed forth at each heave of her breast, 
As her lips to His sandals were throbbingly pressed; 
As her lips to His sandals were throbbingly pressed.  
In the sky, after tempest, as shineth the bow, 
In glance of the sunshine, as melteth the snow, 

He looked on that lost one: “her sins were forgiv’n,” 
And the sinner went forth in the beauty of Heav’n; 
And the sinner went forth in the beauty of Heav’n.</content>

		<title>Abide With Me</title>
		<content>The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me.  
		
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day; Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou who changest not, abide with me. 

Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word; But as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord, Familiar, condescending, patient, free. Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.  Come not in terrors, as the King of kings, But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings, Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea— Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.  

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile; And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile, Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee, On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.  I need Thy presence every passing hour. 

What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power? Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be? Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.  I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. 

Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still, if Thou abide with me. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes; Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies. Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee; In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</content>

Ave Maria! Mother blest, to whom, caressing and caressed, clings the eternal Child; favoured beyond Archangels' dream, when first on thee with tendered gleam thy new-born Savior smiled.  
		
Thou wept'st meek Maiden, Mother mild., thou wept'st upon thy sinless Child, thy very heart was riven: and yet, what mourning matron here would deem thy sorrows bought too dear by all on this side heaven!  

A Son that never did amiss, that never shamed his Mother's kiss, nor crossed her fondest prayer: e'en from the Tree he deigned to bow for her his agonized brow, her, his sole earthly care.  

Ave Maria! thou whose name all but adoring love may claim, yet may we reach thy shrine; for he, thy Son and Savior, vows to crown all lowly lofty brows with love and joy like thine.</content>

		<title>Battle Hymn of the Republic</title>
		<content>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.  
		
I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.  

I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel; “As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal”; Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel, Since God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.  

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.  

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me: As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;  While God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.  

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave, He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave; So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave, Our God is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.</content>

		<content>“Be not afraid, ’tis I, ’tis I, Though the storm rages wild; In thy sore need I’m passing by, Off’ring to help thee, hear thy cry— Be of good cheer, My child.”  
		
“Be not afraid, ’tis I, Be not afraid, ’tis I”; Though wild winds blowing, My bark o’erflowing, God rules in earth and sky;

“Be not afraid, ’tis I, Be not afraid, ’tis I”; The storm can’t harm my trusting soul, For Jesus walks the waves that roll; His voice I hear, which calms my fear, “ ’Tis I, be not afraid.”  

Be not afraid, ’mid pressing foes, Jesus is watching near; He all thy deepest sorrow knows, Walked every step thy pathway goes; Trust Him, then; do not fear.  

Be not afraid, He knows thy heart, And He doth care for thee; Of all thy grief He shares a part, Stands by thy side, He’ll not depart, If thou wilt faithful be.  

Be not afraid, O helpless one, Trust in His boundless grace; Say from the heart, “Thy will be done, Finish the work Thou hast begun, Bring me to see Thy face.”</content>

		<title>Day by Day</title>

He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure Gives unto each day what He deems best— Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil with peace and rest.  
		
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me With a special mercy for each hour; All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me, He Whose Name is Counselor and Power; The protection of His child and treasure Is a charge that on Himself He laid; “As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,” This the pledge to me He made.  

Help me then in every tribulation So to trust Thy promises, O Lord, That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation Offered me within Thy holy Word. Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, Ever to take, as from a father’s hand, One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, Till I reach the promised land.</content>

I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within; There at the cross where He took me in; Glory to His Name!

Glory to His Name, glory to His Name: There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name! 

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet; Plunge in today, and be made complete; Glory to His Name!

		<title>His Eye is on the Sparrow</title>
		<content>Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come, Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home, When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
		
I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.  

“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear, And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears; Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.  

I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.  

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise, When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies, I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.  

I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.   </content>

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help Love lifted me!  

All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I’ll cling In His blessèd presence live, ever His praises sing, Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul’s best songs, Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs.  

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help Love lifted me!  

Souls in danger look above, Jesus completely saves, He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves. He’s the Master of the sea, billows His will obey, He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.

Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.  

Through death into life everlasting He passed, and we follow Him there; Over us sin no more hath dominion— For more than conquerors we are!  

Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.  

His Word shall not fail you—He promised; Believe Him, and all will be well: Then go to a world that is dying, His perfect salvation to tell!

And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? 

And did the countenance divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

And was Jerusalem builded here Among those dark satanic mills?

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control, That Christ has regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul.  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! My sin, not in part but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live: If Jordan above me shall roll, No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait, The sky, not the grave, is our goal; Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord! Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!  

It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.  

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll; The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, Even so, it is well with my soul.

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  

He speaks, and the sound of His voice, Is so sweet the birds hush their singing, And the melody that He gave to me Within my heart is ringing.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  

I’d stay in the garden with Him Though the night around me be falling, But He bids me go; through the voice of woe His voice to me is calling.  

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.  </content>

When my feeble life is o’er, Time for me will be no more; Guide me gently, safely o’er To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.  

Just a closer walk with Thee, Grant it, Jesus, is my plea, Daily walking close to Thee, Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.</content>

		<title>Nearer My God To Thee</title>
		<content>Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me, Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.  
		
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  

Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  

There let the way appear, steps unto Heav’n; All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given; Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee.  

Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  

Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise; So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.  

Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  

Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky, Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I’ll fly, Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.  

There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest, There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest; Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee. 

Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.  </content>

		<title>Blessed Assurance</title>
		<content>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! O what a foretaste of glory divine! Heir of salvation, purchase of God, Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.  
		
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long; This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long.  

Perfect submission, perfect delight, Visions of rapture now burst on my sight; Angels descending bring from above Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.  

This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long; This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long.  

Perfect submission, all is at rest I in my Savior am happy and blest, Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.  

This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long; This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long.</content>

		<title>23rd Psalm</title>
		<content>The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want; He makes me down to lie In pastures green; he leadeth me The quiet waters by.  
		
My soul he doth restore again, And me to walk doth make Within the paths of righteousness, E'en for his own name's sake. 

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will I fear no ill: For thou art with me, and thy rod And staff me comfort still.  

My table thou hast furnished In prsence of my foes; My head thou dost with oil anoint And my cup overflows.  

Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely follow me; And in God's house for evermore My dwelling-place shall be.</content>

		<title>The Old Rugged Cross</title>
		<content>On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, The emblem of suffering and shame; And I love that old cross where the dearest and best For a world of lost sinners was slain.  
		
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, Has a wondrous attraction for me; For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above To bear it to dark Calvary.  

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, A wondrous beauty I see, For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, To pardon and sanctify me.  

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. 

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true; Its shame and reproach gladly bear; Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away, Where His glory forever I’ll share. 

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown. </content>

		<title>To God Be The Glory</title>
		<content>To God be the glory, great things He has done; So loved He the world that He gave us His Son, Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, And opened the life gate that all may go in.  
		
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, To every believer the promise of God; The vilest offender who truly believes, That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.  

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  

Great things He has taught us, great things He has done, And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son; But purer, and higher, and greater will be Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He has done.  </content>

		<title>The Holy City</title>
		<content>Last night I lay a-sleeping There came a dream so fair, I stood in old Jerusalem Beside the temple there. I heard the children singing, And ever as they sang, Me thought the voice of angels From heaven in answer rang.  
		
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing, Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna to your King!  And then me thought my dream was changed, The streets no longer rang, Hushed were the glad Hosannas The little children sang. The sun grew dark with mystery, The morn was cold and chill, As the shadow of a cross arose Upon a lonely hill.  

Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Hark! How the angels sing, Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna to your King!  And once again the scene was changed; New earth there seemed to be; I saw the Holy City Beside the tideless sea; The light of God was on its streets, The gates were open wide, And all who would might enter, And no one was denied. No need of moon or stars by night, Or sun to shine by day; It was the new Jerusalem That would not pass away.  

Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Sing for the night is o'er! Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna for evermore!</content>

Run the straight race through God’s good grace, Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face; Life with its way before us lies, Christ is the Path, and Christ the Prize.  

Cast care aside, upon thy Guide, Lean, and His mercy will provide; Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove Christ is its Life, and Christ its Love.  Faint not nor fear, His arms are near, He changeth not, and thou art dear. Only believe, and thou shalt see That Christ is all in all to thee.</content>

		<title>Jesus Paid It All</title>
		<content>I hear the Savior say, “Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.”  
		
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

For nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, I’ll wash my garments white In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

And now complete in Him My robe His righteousness, Close sheltered ’neath His side, I am divinely blest. 

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone, Can change the leper’s spots And melt the heart of stone. 

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

When from my dying bed My ransomed soul shall rise, “Jesus died my soul to save,” Shall rend the vaulted skies.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.  

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete, I’ll lay my trophies down All down at Jesus’ feet.  

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</content>

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands, Robed in the blooming garb of spring; Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, Who makes the woeful heart to sing.  Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight, And all the twinkling starry host; Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer Than all the angels heaven can boast.  

All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly, Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee; None can be nearer, fairer or dearer, Than Thou, my Savior, art to me.  Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations! Son of God and Son of Man! Glory and honor, praise, adoration, Now and forever more be Thine.</content>

		<content>I was sure by now,God, You would have reached down and wiped our tears away, stepped in and saved the day. But once again, I say amen and it’s still raining  as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you” and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.  
		
And I’ll praise you in this storm and I will lift my hands for You are who You are no matter where I am and every tear I’ve cried You hold in your hand You never left my side and though my heart is torn I will praise You in this storm 

I remember when I stumbled in the wind You heard my cry to You and raised me up again my strength is almost gone how can I carry on if I can’t find You  as the thunder rolls I barely hear You whisper through the rain, “I’m with you” and as Your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.  

I lift my eyes onto the hills where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth I lift my eyes onto the hills where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth  

And I’ll praise you in this storm and I will lift my hands for You are who You are no matter where I am and every tear I’ve cried You hold in your hand You never left my side and though my heart is torn I will praise You in this storm </content>
