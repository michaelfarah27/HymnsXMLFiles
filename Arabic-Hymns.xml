		<content>May my prayer like incense rise before You* M'm lifting up my hands as sacrifice Oh Lord Jesus turn Your eyes upon me For I know there is mercy in Your sight  Your statutes are my heritage forever My heart is set on keeping your decrees So still my anxious urge toward rebellion And let love keep my will on its knees
		
Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You  
		
To all creation I can see a limit But Your commands are boundless and have none So Your Word is my joy and meditation From the rising to the setting of the sun  

All Your ways are loving and are faithful The road is narrow but Your burden light Because You gladly lean to lead the humble I shall gladly kneel to leave my pride 

Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You Oh God, You are my God And I will ever praise You  

I will seek You in the morning I will look to walk in Your ways And step by step You'll lead me And I will follow You all of my days
